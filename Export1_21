Welcome!        In your opinion, at this very moment, what do you think is the best way to reach your weight-loss goals with Noom?   
NEXT
A. Exclusively eat salads.
B. Exercise for 30 minutes a day.
C. Take lots of supplements.
D. Simply believe.
It’s    D. Simply believe.         


I BELIEVE
Simply believe           We started out with this concept because it’s just so important. Whether you think you can or you think you can’t, you’re right.                 In psychology, it’s called       self-efficacy      —the belief in your own ability to succeed.                  If you believe you will reach your goals, you will; if you don’t, you won’t. We know you can do it, but you need to know it, too.        So before we get started, we have just one question: Do you    believe   ?      
 What makes Noom different?

A. Noom uses psychology to help you learn and change.
B. You don’t have to eliminate any foods (or eat anything you don’t want to).
C. Exercise is optional (but encouraged).
D. How—and why—you eat are more important than what you eat.
E. Things like sleep, stress, and healthy relationships matter just as much as food and exercise.
F. All of the above.
G. None of the above.
 It’s    F. All of the above.    Wherever you’ve been, whatever you’ve tried, this time will be different. But seriously, we’re not just saying that—we’re psychologists. Helping people change for the better is kind of our thing.       


NEXT
     Just to get to this point, you’ve had to answer a lot of questions. (Thanks for taking the time!) We’ll use your answers to customize Noom to meet your needs, and to give your coaching team the information they need to best support you.                 You probably have some questions of your own:    What is Noom? And how is it going to help me get healthier, exactly?              Well, we won’t leave you hanging (we wouldn’t dare).       


GET STARTED
Everything you need to succeed is right here:    <ol><li>   A customized course    that’s rooted in science and psychology and empowers you to live your healthiest (dare we say best?) life.</li><li>   An expert team   —including your Noom guides and a 1:1 coaching option—that will be there through it all.</li><li>   Food logging    with real-time feedback to help you make healthier choices and discover what balance looks like for you. (Yes, you can have birthday cake. You can even have Tuesday cake.) </li></ol>     Excited? Overwhelmed? Don’t worry, we’ll introduce each aspect of your Noom program in its own article over the next few days.        Now it’s time to get started with your first    Noom course   .

WHAT’S A NOOM EXPERT?
    If you listened to the lesson, tap below to set your learning goal.                   
Set my learning goal
               A wise person once said, “The journey of 1,000 miles begins with a single step.”              We say, “While the journey to becoming a Noom Expert begins with a single step, it’s luckily much shorter than 1,000 miles.”                   


NEXT
A Noom Expert has learned everything there is to know about their relationship with food and the psychology of weight loss.            When you’re a Noom Expert, you’ll have:      <ul><li>New healthy-eating and exercise habits that are sustainable (nothing extreme, nothing off-limits).</li><li>Good habits beyond nutrition and exercise—from a better sleep routine to regular self-care.</li><li>Lasting motivation and a tool kit of coping skills to manage stress and get back on track after slipups.</li><li>Mindfulness in all areas of your life (including eating choices, of course).</li><li>An improved relationship with food and your body.</li><li>Progress that extends far beyond the scale. From more confidence to better communication skills, the benefits will keep on coming.</li></ul>


NEXT
    Throughout your experience, you’ll complete 10 mini-courses that cover everything you need to know to become a Noom Expert.    Way better than 1,000 miles, right?                 Each mini-course will end with a final quiz (not as scary as it sounds, promise), which helps build your confidence, encourages motivation, and ensures you’ve learned key concepts before graduating to the next mini-course.                 While becoming a Noom Expert won’t happen overnight, you’ll be getting a little bit stronger every day and growing into a new version of yourself along the way.               To track your progress, we divided your journey into four phases:      <ul><li>Noom Novice</li><li>Noom Apprentice</li><li>Noom Scholar</li><li>Noom Expert</li></ul>    


SOUNDS GOOD TO ME
    As a Noom Novice, you’ll learn what Noom is all about and finally understand that there’s an entire psychology to weight loss and your relationship with food.    Little by little, the challenges you complete will make you realize that you’ve got the power.        When you’re a    Noom Apprentice, you’ll start noticing that the new habits you’re developing are becoming second nature, and you’re feeling more motivated than ever      .    Habits like meal planning, healthy snacking, reaching your step goal, and enjoying treats in moderation—they’re not easy, but they’re becoming automatic.          As a Noom Scholar, you’ll see progress beyond the scale   —things like having more energy, sleeping better, and feeling more confident in your skin. Bonus: Others will probably start to notice these changes, too. (They might even be a little jealous.)      When you finally graduate to Noom Expert, you’ll feel like you’ve traveled 1,000 miles—in a good way, where you’re sore, and now you know what Everest looks like. But also,    you’ll have entirely remodeled your health habits and redefined your relationships with food, exercise, and, most importantly, yourself      .    At this point, you’ll be ready to apply all the skills you’ve learned here to other areas of your life, including work, productivity, relationships, and beyond.

 Here’s a sneak peek at the road ahead:          <embed alt="courseprogressfixed" embedtype="image" format="fullwidth" id="9020"/>    Each mini-course can be finished within a few days to two weeks, while your journey to becoming a Noom Expert can be completed in 16 weeks. At that point, you can continue into the final phase of the program with the other Noomers who reach this very elite status.               You can track your progress and congratulate yourself (which we highly recommend!) in the “Course progress” section of the app—just tap the icon in the top-right corner.    <embed alt="frame29x3" embedtype="image" format="fullwidth" id="8522"/>      


DONE
You can make progress toward your goals with as little as a few minutes per day.               We’ve found that Noomers who    choose a goal that they can achieve every day are most likely to reach their goals.              That's right. It's not about choosing the most ambitious goal, but the most achievable goal. Setting a goal that you can achieve will not only increase your confidence but also help you build the habit of Nooming that much sooner! Based on your target weight loss pace, we recommend starting with 5 to 8 or 9 to 12 minutes per day. (And just so you know, you can always keep going once you’ve reached your goal.)

Design “Your Big Picture”

I’M LISTENING
    If you listened to the lesson, tap below to design YBP.                   
DESIGN YBP
               You came into this program with some serious goals, and we’re here to help you reach them.   The first step in achieving any goal is having a big picture in mind.               Your Big Picture   —   or YBP, as we like to call it—will be a huge source of motivation that also helps you overcome obstacles you experience along the way.            <embed alt="day8-task3-5.png" embedtype="image" format="left" id="4075"/>   


NEXT
First up is your Super Goal: what you want to achieve by the end of the course.         It won’t be set in stone—you can decide to change it anytime, and it may evolve throughout your journey. And as you’ll see, your Super Goal may or may not have to do with the number on the scale.      
    <ul><li>Losing 15 pounds</li><li>Fitting better into your favorite jeans</li><li>Running your first 5K </li><li>Hiking the Grand Canyon </li><li>Feeling confident at a big reunion</li><li>Wearing a swimsuit—and actually enjoying it </li></ul>    
Here are a few examples:
        Once you have your Super Goal, your coaching team will help you break it down into more manageable pieces. And to reach that goal, we’ll want to keep you as    motivated as humanly possible.         
How do we get motivated?

ASK AWAY
 We find our motivation by really, truly understanding the reason we want to reach our Super Goal.    It’s the deep, meaningful       Ultimate Why   ,    the driving force that excites and inspires us to work toward our Super Goal every day.     Finding it takes a bit of self-reflection. Like a relentless five-year-old, you’ll need to    keep asking yourself “Why?” until you’ve gotten to the core of your goal.              
 I want to lose 15 pounds. Why? Because I want to be healthier. Why? Because when I’m healthier, I feel better about myself. Why? Because I feel more confident and comfortable in my own skin. Why? Because I feel proud of myself and have enough energy to accomplish everything I want.      
It’ll sound something like this:
                 The answers you identify along the way are your "whys", and the place where you land is your    Ultimate Why.                 Let’s give yours a shot.

Introducing: NoomCoin

TELL ME MORE
 Things we know to be true: a life without carbs is no life at all, pasta is the most delicious carb, and losing weight is hard.              You can be doing all of the right things—eating your veggies, drinking a lot of water, clocking in 8 hours of sleep—and still not see progress on the scale. Why?    There are hundreds of factors that impact your weight loss, many of which are out of your control    (hormones, muscle mass, and genetics, we're looking at you).            It can be    frustrating.              But we also know something else to be true:    It only takes doing three things consistently to guarantee that you'll lose weight with Noom.      


WHAT'S NOOMCOIN?
The three things you should do consistently, and on as many days as possible, are:<ol><li>Weighing yourself.</li><li>Logging your meals (and tapping ‘finish day’ when you’re done).</li><li>Completing your daily Noom lessons.</li></ol>        We have years of data from Noomers like you to prove it.            So, how can you stay on track to make sure that you’re doing these three simple things every day to reach your weight loss goals?          Introducing: NoomCoin       


SHOW ME THE MONEY
What's a NoomCoin?         A NoomCoin is a token we've created to reward the actions you take    now    that will drive your weight loss    later.                    There’s a lot of digital currency talk in the world right now, but NoomCoins are different. First, they're simple (no conversions needed), and two, they're priceless.           You can’t buy NoomCoins with real money,    you can only earn them.                           You’ll earn 1 NoomCoin every time you complete the healthy habits trilogy: Weigh in, log all of your meals for the day, and achieve your learning goal.           


READY FOR SUCCESS
     Some fast NoomCoin facts         On average:   <ul><li>   Noomers lose one pound for every 5 NoomCoins they earn.    This number will vary depending on your unique journey, but it's a good estimate for most people.</li><li>   Noomers who earn at least 10 NoomCoins in the first two weeks are twice as likely to reach their weight loss goals.   </li></ul>            You'll also reap rewards beyond the number on the scale by sticking to the commitment you made for yourself with Noom—more energy, less stress, improved confidence, and more.   
 Pop quiz:   Which of the following is    necessary    for you to earn a NoomCoin? 
NEXT
A. Eat 1 cup of grapes.
B. Lose 1 pound.
C. Log breakfast, lunch, and dinner, or tap 'Finish Day’ when you're done eating for the day.
    It's: C. Log breakfast, lunch, and dinner, or tap ‘Finish Day’ when you're done eating for the day.    This lets us know that you’ve logged all of your meals and snacks on any given day.      


Next
      Let's recap.   You'll earn a NoomCoin when you take all three actions in a day:<ol><li>Log your weight.</li><li>Log breakfast, lunch, and dinner, or tap ‘Finish Day’ after your last meal or snack of the day.</li><li>Achieve the learning goal you chose by completing all of your assigned lessons.</li></ol>        That being said,    we’re gifting you with your first NoomCoin for completing this lesson, to get you off to a strong start.              You'll be able to watch your wallet grow by going to the course progress page at any time. Now, it's time to collect your first NoomCoin.

Prepare your scale

LET'S
 At Noom, we recommend regular weigh-ins as part of your program to track your progress and understand how your new habits are helping you achieve your goals.              At the same time, we also know that stepping on the scale can feel intimidating or stressful for some people.            So let’s ease into it with some science behind the scale.    
     Your weight is likely to change if:      
NEXT
A. You’ve been stranded on a desert island (or a dessert island).
B. You eat a salty meal.
C. You step on the scale at the doctor's office.
D. It’s Tuesday.
E. All of the above.
F. None of the above.
 It’s    E. All of the above.    Weight fluctuates throughout the day based on how hydrated you are, how much salt you eat, which scale you use… the list goes on.           Gaining 1 pound requires consuming 3,500 extra calories, so if the scale changes a few pounds in a day, it’s likely a natural fluctuation—not true weight change. That’s why we recommend stepping on the scale on a consistent basis.   
 The best time to weigh yourself is:      
NEXT
A. First thing after you wake up.
B. After your morning coffee (the best time to do most things).
C. Once you’ve eaten your last meal of the day.

Start eating less dense

TRUE
Feeling full on fewer calories     Imagine two meals: a quarter-pound cheeseburger and a quarter pound of arugula.    While they weigh the same, the burger has 14 times the calories.         Here’s where it gets interesting:    If you eat the (much lower-calorie) arugula, you could be just as full as if you ate the burger.    (Also, you won’t have ketchup on your face.)


TELL ME MORE
Less dense, greater results    Multiple scientific studies have proven that    food weight, not calories, is a huge factor in how full you feel.    That’s why when recommending what to eat, we always evaluate a food’s       caloric density (CD)      .      <h5><embed alt="caloriedensityequation" embedtype="image" format="right" id="3850"/>   </h5>        When you eat low-CD foods, you’ll feel full quicker with fewer calories. When you eat foods with high CD, you need to eat more calories to feel full.          So our philosophy is simple:    Eat more foods with low caloric density      .    (Don’t worry, we’ll help you do this.)      


NEXT
The more water a food has, the lower its caloric density. The secret is water. It has zero calories and the ability to make you feel full. In other words,    water is basically a miracle ingredient.         
 That being said, which food do you think has a lower CD?      
NEXT
A. A juicy grape.
B. A shriveled raisin.
 It’s    A. A juicy grape.           Since they’re the ones with the water, they have lower CD. Think of it this way: You could eat 1 pound of grapes for 306 calories, or 1/5 pound of raisins for the same 306 calories. If you choose the grapes, you’ll be full. If you choose the raisins, you’ll be left wanting more. This is why grapes are better for snacking—you’ll end up eating fewer calories without even thinking about it.   


NEXT
Here’s how to start eating less dense:     It’s not just grapes that have low caloric density. There are so many other foods—like chicken breast, low-fat Greek yogurt, salsa, watermelon, and whole-grain bread—that do, too.       In other words,    you don’t have to eat like a rabbit.          Here are some tricks to get you started:              
    <ul><li>Opt for hard-boiled eggs instead of fried eggs.</li><li>Replace 1/2 cup of granola with 1/2 cup of oatmeal cooked in water.</li><li>Spread whole-grain toast with 2 tablespoons of unsweetened jam instead of peanut butter.</li></ul>    
Breakfast
    <ul><li>Top a salad with tuna packed in water instead of tuna packed in oil. </li><li>Use lettuce or collard greens as a wrap instead of a tortilla. </li><li>Start your meal with a broth-based vegetable soup instead of a cream-based soup.</li></ul>    
Lunch
    <ul><li>Cook your vegetables in a nonstick pan instead of sautéing them in oil.</li><li>Replace 1 cup of traditional pasta with 1 cup of spaghetti squash.</li><li>Serve your chicken with a baked potato instead of fries.</li></ul>    
Dinner
    <ul><li>Swap a serving of chips with 3 cups of plain air-popped popcorn.</li><li>Serve 1 cup of low-fat yogurt instead of 1 cup of full-fat yogurt.</li><li>Snack on 1 cup of grapes instead of 1/4 cup of raisins.</li></ul>    
Snacks
We know, easier said than done

SET MEAL REMINDERS NOW
 Information is great, but putting it into practice is a different story.              As you begin to log your meals, you’ll have a personalized calorie goal to use as a learning tool.    Most people go over their ideal range at first (surprise!), and you probably will, too. That’s fine. It’s all about striving for progress, not perfection. In time, you'll find the balance that works for you.              For now, it’s time to start building the habit of logging your meals. Go on and customize your meal reminders for a time that fits your schedule.

IT’S A MIRACLE
   It’s E. Depends on a few things.           You’ve probably heard something about needing to drink 8 cups of water a day. While that’s a worthy goal, water is a bit more complicated than that.          Your sex, age, weight, height, and activity level play the biggest roles in your water needs. If you’re like most people, 2 to 3 liters (or 8 to 12 cups) should be enough to keep your body hydrated each day   . But things like exercising more often, being in a warmer or more humid environment, or experiencing health changes can increase the amount of water you need in a day.       So we’ve built a tool to help you set water goals and track your progress.               


NEXT
Noom's water tracker        Find it by tapping 'Track more progress,' then 'Log water.' Here, you can set your daily water goal.            Once you toggle it on and set your goal, you’ll see it on your home screen. You’ll be able to track how much you drink throughout the day.           <embed alt="grame 28x3" embedtype="image" format="fullwidth" id="8519"/>      


SET MY WATER GOAL
To help you reach your goals faster, here are four hydration tricks:       1.    Warm it up   : Drink a cup of herbal tea or hot water with lemon. Since they’re both hydrating, they count as “water.”    2.    Add bubbles   : Have a glass of sparkling or seltzer water—this absolutely counts, too.       3.    Flavor it   : Add fresh-squeezed lemon and lime, a handful of berries, or a splash of 100% juice.       4.    Wake up and water   : First thing in the morning, polish off a large glass of water. It’ll kick-start your water intake and is a great way to rehydrate after a long night’s sleep.                  
5.    Keep it around   : Out of sight, out of mind. So, carry a reusable water bottle with you throughout the day.    6.    Take a break   : Replace your traditional morning coffee break with a water break.           7.    Serve it as a side   : Serve (and commit to finishing) a glass of water with each meal and snack.              
And here are more hydration tricks if you need them:

A. The number of calories in a dish.
B. The number of calories divided by the weight of a food.
C. The hottest way to hear music in 1985.
 It’s    B. The number of calories divided by the weight of a food      .    CD stands for       caloric density      . Foods with low CD are filling and keep hunger at bay.      
 3. If you’re trying to lose weight, the better choice is:      
NEXT
A. 60 calories of raisins.
B. 60 calories of grapes.
C. Doesn’t matter—60 calories is 60 calories.
 It’s    B. 60 calories of grapes.    Since grapes are rich in water, they’ll fill you up more than raisins.       
 4. For losing weight, it’s good to eat foods with lots of:      
NEXT
A. Molecules
B. Fat
C. Air
D. Water
 It’s    D. Water.    Water doesn’t contain any calories, but when it’s inside the food you eat, it fills you up. For example, a 3-pound watermelon only has 409 calories. Eat that and be full for hours (but maybe a little sick to your stomach).

C. Some example Super Goals are “losing 15 pounds” and “feeling confident at a big reunion.”
D. All of the above.
 It’s    D. All of the above.    Your Super Goal is the goal you want to accomplish by the end of your course. It can be related to your weight (like losing 15 pounds) or extend far beyond that (like hiking the Grand Canyon).            Whatever your Super Goal is, it’s an important part of YBP—and we’re here every step of the way to help you achieve it.   
 6. True or false? If your weight goes up by 2 pounds from one day to the next, you gained 2 pounds of fat overnight.

A. True
B. False
 It’s    B. False   —your weight fluctuates daily. There are so many factors that impact your weight—like the scale you’re using, how hydrated you are, the foods you ate yesterday, and whether you’ve gone to the bathroom or not. Just be as consistent as you can when you weigh in (think: same time, same place, same scale), but look for trends over time rather than stressing over daily fluctuations.

The year you've been waiting for

I'VE MADE IT
 Here we are. And here YOU are.          We made it. You made it.           2023 is upon us. The year you've been waiting for.          


I AM, AREN'T I?
    This past year you've likely experienced a lot. Fun and exciting times. Challenging and unknown times. And everything in between. Whatever you've been through, there have most definitely been days, weeks, or seasons that made you dig deep and persevere.          The fact that you're still standing, means this:          You're one resilient human being.        


IT'S MY YEAR
 And fact that you're here    now    (and with Noom) means even more:       You've got the will, the strength, and the perseverance that it takes to change your life. And the time is now.      It would be easy to put off your goals to another week, another month, or even another year. Or to wait until there are no doubts in your mind that you can achieve (and sustain) your goals.           But instead,    you're choosing to show up for yourself.          You're honoring the voice inside your head that    knows    that you can take what you've learned and how much you've grown in 2022 to make a positive change—to change your habits, to improve your health, and to ultimately lead the life you deserve.         It's the year you've been waiting for. It's your year.   


Next
 While we're firm believers that there's never a perfect time to make a change, a new year is better than any other.       Real talk: A new year isn't going to solve all our problems.    But,    a new year          can    bring a renewed sense of hope, optimism, and opportunity.    What better recipe for achieving your goals?          All you need to do is believe you can   . And you can, because you're here.           What do you say?

Orange Foods Aren't Off Limits?!

Got it!
 We know you're a human being, not a rabbit, which means that we don't expect you to eat only salads    (believe it or not, #NoomNerdsAreHumansToo   ). We want you to eat healthy for the rest of your life and giving up desserts forever is neither sustainable nor as yummy.        That's why we developed a unique color system to help you easily understand what's in the foods you're eating, so you can make healthier food choices every day and for the long-term.   
 are the least calorie-dense and/or contain the highest concentration of healthy nutrients. Think: fruits, veggies and whole grains -- these should make up the bulk of your diet and can be eaten in larger quantities.   
Green Foods
 have more calories and/or less healthy nutrients per serving than green foods. We're talking lean meats, legumes, and low-fat dairy -- foods that should be eaten in moderate portions.   
Yellow Foods
 are the most calorie-dense and/or have the least healthy nutrients. Examples of orange foods include red meats and desserts -- the goodies that should be eaten less frequently and in smaller portions.   
Orange Foods


Let's break it down...
 Most of your diet won't be green foods -- and that's fine.        It's important to remember that    "orange" doesn't mean bad and "green" doesn't mean good.    We like to think of our color system as a portion guide and recommend the following breakdown:       <ul><li>Green: 30%</li></ul><ul><li>Yellow: 45%</li></ul><ul><li>Orange: 25%</li></ul>           "Orange" foods simply raise a "caution flag" for foods that contains a lot of calories without filling you up!    So while you can eat "green" foods in larger quantities, you need to be more mindful of how much "orange" foods you're eating.   


Nailed it!
 Our color system is a hammer in your toolkit for long-term success -- to bang out new behaviors, reinforce habits you already have, and remove any unwanted nails in your sides. Use it to:       <ol><li>    Make decisions in the moment:    "Should I order a baked potato or a creamy mashed?"   </li><li>    Analyze your past food choices:    "I don't typically have green foods until dinner -- yikes!"   </li><li>    Identify new opportunities for the future:    "Maybe I can replace 80% ground beef (orange food) with 95% lean ground beef or turkey (yellow foods) next time."   </li></ol>


Next
 Every time you log a food, Noom will instantly let you know whether it's orange, yellow or green.  After a while, you'll get to know which foods are which. Below are some examples of foods in each of the three categories so you can start to wrap your head around which food is what color.

Break down your calorie goal and fuel your goals

LET'S DO IT
 Take a listen by tapping play below or scroll down to read.          
              
UNLOCK NEXT LESSON
        -----           As you’ve noticed, Noom's food logging feature also includes a recommended calorie range that you should be aiming to meet each day.                 That being said, there’s a lot of science and careful consideration that goes into setting your specific goals.            So, we wanted to break it down to help you understand how it's set and explore how you make sure you're eating to fuel your goals.    


NEXT
 We use your age, height, current weight, sex, and basic activity level to calculate the approximate number of calories your body uses in a day (your total daily energy expenditure or TDEE), based on the Harris-Benedict equation.                    Remember: to lose weight, we have to expend more calories than we take in—what we call a caloric deficit.    Eating in a deficit of 500 calories per day will typically result in about one pound lost per week—research shows that this is a healthy caloric deficit to allow your body to function at its best while also losing weight. So, we subtract this from your TDEE to create your calorie target. [We let you adjust this (within a healthy range) based on your goals—more on this soon!]          We also adjust your daily calorie target based on your activity level.    When you burn energy through exercise, we recommend that you replenish this energy and fuel your activity by consuming more calories. That's why Noom will add back about half of the number of calories you burn through activity (as long as you log it in the app or you have a wearable device synced).              


NEXT
 As you may have noticed, your calorie target includes a range of a couple hundred calories on either end. That’s because we want you to strive for progress, not perfection.                  How you eat isn’t going to be the same day-to-day. Your calorie goal needs to be realistic and healthy, and it’s not realistic to assume you will hit that exact calorie target every day.                     That being said, you can adjust your calorie target if you’d like to.    Noom sets your recommended calorie range for you based on the information you gave us about your sex, age, weight, and height, but you can manually adjust your total by clicking “settings” in the menu tab. If you have a set calorie number from a doctor, registered dietitian, or other qualified healthcare provider, you can adjust the calorie target accordingly.            Or, if you are experiencing other lifestyle changes that require you to eat more calories, we recommend that you make that adjustment.            Noom won’t let females adjust their calories below 1,200-1,320 calories per day, and 1,400-1,540 for males to keep your body functioning at its best.   


NEXT
When to adjust your calorie target    <ul><li>   Your activity level is increased:    If you're expending more energy through exercise, then it's recommended that you replenish that energy with more food. Log your activity in Noom or sync the app to a wearable device, and this will increase your calorie goal—Noom will automatically add more calories to your calorie target based on your activity (about half of what you burned with exercise). Note that adding activity to Noom is not a way to “earn” food, rather to make up for energy lost with exercise—it's important to fuel your activity.</li></ul><ul><li>   You’re lactating      :    You're not allowed to join Noom if you are pregnant. If you're lactating, talk to your doctor before embarking on any type of weight-loss plan. In general, it's recommended to eat at least 500-1000 more calories per day while lactating. Please note that calorie needs vary based on lactation intensity, so consult with a doctor to find the right calorie goal for you.</li></ul><ul><li>   You’re hungry      :    If you’re regularly feeling hungry after reaching your calorie goal for the day, we recommend starting by adding about 100-200 calories (or a small snack) to your calorie goal and seeing how you feel.   </li></ul>    


NEXT
 All of that said, your calorie target is a recommendation.    It’s important to note that       less is not best when it comes to your calorie target—you should aim to be eating in your calorie range, not below it.           Your body needs calories as energy to function (even basic bodily functions like breathing and blood pumping require energy!), and going below your calorie target can lead to headache, fatigue, a weakened immune system, and slow your metabolism down, among other negative side effects.        As you learn more about your body, your hunger cues, and more, you'll become even more in touch with how much your body needs to reach your goals and feel satisfied.           


DONE
To recap, your daily calorie target is:    <ul><li>Based on research and clinical recommendations for healthy weight loss    </li><li>Personalized for each person   </li><li>A recommendation that you should aim to meet (at minimum!)   </li><li>Able to be manually adjusted    </li></ul> Now you know a little more about how and why we ask you to track your calories. This will set you up for success on the Noom program—we’re rooting for you!

Break down your calorie goal

NEXT
 The Noom curriculum is based on psychology to help you make healthier choices. And part of the program also includes a meal log that tracks your calories.                  At Noom, we give you a suggested calorie range, and we let you know how many calories you have left in your day after you log each meal.            But the calorie target isn’t just a random number—there’s a lot of science and careful consideration that goes into landing on these goals.    


NEXT
 When you signed up for Noom, we asked you to answer a bunch of questions (thank you for doing that!). And that was for a reason—we used your info, including your age, height, current weight, and sex, to determine the best calorie target for you.                 The number you’re assigned is based on the Harris-Benedict equation formula, which is used to calculate your approximate basal metabolic rate (BMR). BMR is the amount of calories you would expend each day even if you did not move at all; your body is continuously burning calories and using energy to keep you alive and working at its best. We then factor in a basic activity level to account for daily movement (think: making your bed, doing laundry, cooking, and more) to calculate your total daily energy expenditure (TDEE).           From there, we determine what is a healthy caloric deficit to allow your body to keep functioning properly while also losing weight. Remember: in order to lose weight, we have to burn more calories than we take in.           


NEXT
 All of that said, your suggested calorie target is just that: a suggestion. It’s important to note that    less is not best when it comes to your calorie target—you should aim to be eating in your calorie range, not below it      .               Your body needs calories as energy to function (even basic bodily functions like breathing and blood pumping require energy!), and going below your calorie target can lead to headache, fatigue, a weakened immune system, and slow your metabolism down, among other negative side effects.    


DONE
 And while we give you a suggested calorie number to aim for each day, we also provide a range of a couple hundred calories on either end. That’s because we want you to strive for progress, not perfection. How you eat isn’t going to be the same day-to-day. Your calorie goal needs to be realistic and healthy, and it’s not realistic to assume you will hit the exact calorie target every day.        We don’t want you to feel like you’ve “failed” if you go over your calorie target. Looking at your meal log is a way to reflect on your eating habits and see what is working for you and where you have areas to improve.        And remember: if you go over your calorie target one day, don’t cut calories the next day to compensate.       Use the calorie range as a guide rather than a hard-and-fast rule.

Adjusting your calorie goal

NEXT
 As part of the Noom program, we give you a suggested calorie target to aim for each day based on science. We have an article that explains this more titled “Break down your calorie goal,” which is in your saved library. When you log your food, we let you know how many calories were in your meal and how many calories you have left for the day.    


NEXT
 While we use science to inform your suggested calorie target, we want you to explore your daily calorie target and adjust the amount based on your goals, how you’re feeling, and other lifestyle factors that might impact how many calories you should be eating each day.                     That being said, you can adjust your calorie target if you’d like to.    Click 'Settings' in the menu tab, and then manually adjust your calorie target. If you have a set calorie number from a doctor, registered dietitian, or other qualified healthcare provider, you can adjust the calorie target accordingly.            Or, if you're experiencing specific life circumstances or scenarios that require you to eat more calories (more on that in a couple slides), we recommend that you make that adjustment.   


NEXT
              Noom won’t let females adjust their calories below 1,200-1,320 calories per day, and 1,400-1,540 for males to keep your body functioning at its best. So eating in a healthy caloric deficit still means you aren’t going below the recommended minimum.                  It’s important to note that    less is not best when it comes to your calorie target—you should aim to be eating in your calorie range, not below it      .               Your body needs calories as energy to function, and going below your calorie target can lead to headache, fatigue, a weakened immune system, and slow your metabolism down, among other negative side effects.

You should always feel satisfied after eating—remember, being physically hungry is a sign your body needs to eat.

Your recipe for a healthy relationship with food

YOU READ MY MIND
 So we know that labeling foods as "good" or "bad," "guilt-free" or "indulgent" can perpetuate an unhealthy relationship with food. And yet, we also know that this type of all-or-nothing thinking is very common, especially in the world of weight loss.            Now you might be asking yourself: What might a healthy relationship with food look like, then?   


TELL ME MORE
 At Noom we believe that a healthy relationship with food will look different for each person—we are all unique, after all.            That being said, we've identified 4 “ingredients” that make up a recipe for a healthy relationship with food:              <ol><li>Permission to eat all foods   </li><li>Enjoying all foods without feelings of guilt or shame   </li><li>Making mindful food choices   </li><li>Honoring your body's feedback</li></ol>       


NEXT
Ingredient 1: Permission to eat all foods        Allowing yourself to eat all foods and food groups. Giving yourself permission to eat foods you love—be it dumplings or a Greek salad—at any time is key to fostering a mindset around food that isn't restrictive, but free.       Let us repeat:    You can eat any food at any time.    We're here to help you understand    why    you're making certain food choices, not police them.             


NEXT
Ingredient 2: Enjoying foods without feelings of guilt or shame    When you do allow yourself to enjoy foods you like, this should come without feelings of guilt or regret (or continuing to think about your choices hours after eating). Now, we aren't naive—we know that this might not feel so easy in the world we live in. (Seriously, have you ever noticed how many foods at the supermarket are labeled "guilt-free"? The answer is: a lot.). What we do know is that continuing to remove "good" and "bad" labels from food can help us feel okay after eating just about anything.          


NEXT
Ingredient 3: Making mindful food choices    While we don't want you spending most of your waking hours thinking about food, applying mindfulness to your food choices when planning your meals or sitting down to eat is important in developing a healthy relationship with food. This means using your knowledge of nutrition and your wants and preferences to enjoy foods that make you feel good in body, mind, and spirit.          


NEXT
Ingredient 4: Honoring your body's feedback         We put a lot of thought, effort, flexibility, and—most importantly—science into calculating your customized calorie range. That being said, as you've learned,    your needs can vary from day to day, and your body knows what you need at any given moment.    It’s better than any math equation.        If you've reached your calorie goal and are still feeling hungry, there's only one appropriate response: eat (and eat until you feel satisfied!).             


COUNT ME IN
 While this recipe might feel    simple    in nature (it's only 4 ingredients, right?!), we know that our relationship with food is complicated, especially for those of us who've attempted to change our eating habits or lose weight in the past.            That being said, from exploring all-or-nothing thinking to identifying subtle hunger and fullness cues, we're here to guide you towards developing the habits that will help you feel good about your relationship with food for life.

Resource: Eating disorders and disordered eating

NEXT
 At Noom, we’re here to help people live healthier lives through behavior change. However, as we've noted, the Noom Weight program should not be used by people who have an eating disorder, and may also not be suitable for people who have a history of disordered eating.               The Noom curriculum is based in psychology and aims to help Noomers develop a healthier relationship with food. But the program also includes tools such as weighing in and tracking your calories, as well as some topics discussed, which may feel triggering for people who have a history of eating disorders or disordered eating.               We take this extremely seriously, so we've outlined information about eating disorders and disordered eating to raise awareness and provide resources in this article.                      A note that this article is not to be used to diagnose or treat eating disorders or disordered eating. If you think you might have an eating disorder, please stop using Noom and visit a doctor or other qualified healthcare provider specializing in eating disorders as soon as possible—they can help you receive a proper diagnosis, discuss treatment options, and determine if Noom is right for you.

What is an eating disorder?            An eating disorder must be diagnosed by a qualified doctor or healthcare provider. The American Psychiatric Association defines eating disorders as mental illnesses in which people experience severe disturbances in their eating behaviors and related thoughts and emotions. People with eating disorders typically become preoccupied with food and their body weight.           Some common eating disorders include:       
 An intense preoccupation with food and body, paired with severe restriction of food intake or cycles of severe restriction and binging. People with anorexia can be underweight (but not always), have an intense fear of gaining weight, and often have a distorted view of themselves (viewing themselves as being at a higher weight than they really are).    
Anorexia nervosa:
 An intense preoccupation with food and body, which is typically paired with a pattern of binge eating (eating a larger than normal amount of food at one time, often accompanied with a feeling of loss of control), followed by purging (usually through self-induced vomiting, taking laxatives, or excessive exercise). To be diagnosed with bulimia, someone must exhibit the binge-purge cycle on average at least once a week for three months.    
Bulimia nervosa:
 Episodes of eating large quantities of food, usually quickly and to the point of feeling sick, and feeling a loss of control during the binge. Binges are usually followed by feelings of guilt, shame, and distress, although aren’t followed by the purging behaviors found in bulimia nervosa.   
Binge eating disorder:
What is disordered eating? While an eating disorder requires an official diagnosis from a medical or mental health professional, disordered eating refers to similar behaviors, including restricting, fasting, binging, and/or purging, and having an intense preoccupation with food, dieting, weight, and body image. People with disordered eating experience significant distress around their eating behaviors that impacts their social life, professional performance, or other important areas of their life.    


NEXT
How to know when your eating behaviors could be a problem:           If your weight loss plan or eating behaviors get in the way of your social life or day-to-day functioning, or are a source of significant distress/anxiety, then you should speak to a professional for an assessment.               Some examples include:           <ul><li>You’re terrified to go out to dinner with friends because you are worried you’ll eat too many calories.   </li><li>You can’t focus at work because you’re hungry all the time and too preoccupied with thoughts about food.    </li><li>You skip out on obligations so you can exercise, binge and purge, or in order to avoid food.   </li></ul>

 They say motivation is what gets you started, and habit is what keeps you going.                 So while we work hard together to help you build better habits, here’s a little affirmation to keep in mind.           <embed alt="sx82stickynote" embedtype="image" format="left" id="6446"/>                 Good things take time.    And anything worth having takes hard work and dedication. (Unless it’s lottery winnings, a hot bath, or food from a pressure cooker.)                    While it would be truly incredible to snap your fingers and achieve your goals just like that, we promise you your success will be all the more rewarding in the end.            Now, ready for some more psychology?

Time to weigh in

I'M ON IT
 Yesterday, you prepared your scale and promised not to weigh yourself.            Well, the wait is over—go ahead and step on it. (And remember, it’s best to do it on a totally empty stomach.)   
WEIGH IN NOW
Learning to love the scale

NEXT
 Did you weigh in this morning? If so, nice work.                    If not, don’t beat yourself up! You probably suffer from a smidge of scale anxiety.        We get it—   stepping on the scale can be scary.    But the first time is always the toughest, so go ahead and just give it a shot.   
 So, how scary was it?    
NEXT
Not scary at all.
 Okay, that was a tiny bit scary.
Not nearly as bad as I imagined.
I need to process what just happened.
I’m scarred for life.



DONE
 If weighing in wasn’t easy for you, know this: It’s not easy for most people. Here are a few Psych Tricks for making difficult situations easier over time.      
    Enter repeatedly into the same tough situation, and it gets increasingly less anxiety-inducing with time.    It’s like building muscle: You do it not once, but over and over again. Psychologists call it       exposure      .                  The opposite is also true.    Consistently avoid an uncomfortable situation, and you’ll build a habit of avoidance      .    (And unhelpful habits like avoidance can be tough to break.)           To build your weigh-in muscles, follow the 3 Ps:   <ol><li>   Plan   : Mark it on your calendar, set phone reminders, or rig a contraption that throws a pie in your face if you don’t weigh in every day. </li><li>   Prep   : Put your scale in a place where you’ll be prompted to use it first thing in the morning.</li><li>   Perform   : Make weighing in a habit. Do it again and again and again. Eventually, you’ll weigh yourself every morning without even thinking about it, just like brushing your teeth. </li></ol>

Find your green-yellow-orange balance

I'M LISTENING
     Okay, who’s ready for some food logging? Anyone?       All right, so logging your food may not exactly sound like a party, but with Noom logging is cool because it’s a learning experience. You learn not only how many calories a food has but also its caloric density, or CD.           
 Remember: Foods with low caloric density (like grapes) fill you up more quickly—and with fewer calories—than foods with high caloric density (like raisins).           That’s why we encourage you to include more low-CD foods on your plate.   
Tap here for a refresher on CD


NEXT
 While we know that foods rich in water usually have low CD, it’s not always obvious which foods those are. To make it all easier, we classify all foods as green, yellow, or orange.          Green foods    have the lowest caloric density and/or the highest concentration of nutrients. Think vegetables and whole grains.          Yellow foods    have a mid-level caloric density and/or a medium concentration of nutrients. Think lean meats and starches.         Orange foods    have the highest caloric density and/or the least nutrients. Think higher-fat meats and desserts.


NEXT
 We know what you’re thinking: I guess this means I’ll be eating a lot of salad. And, sure, we love salads. But sometimes the mood calls for something else. Like, say, nachos. The key is balance.                 That’s why most of your diet won’t be green foods—and that’s fine. We want you to eat healthy for the rest of your life, and giving up desserts (or nachos) forever isn’t exactly sustainable.                 We recommend you eat according to the following balance:              <ul><li>30% green foods</li><li>45% yellow foods</li><li>25% orange foods</li></ul>            Orange doesn’t mean “bad,” and green doesn’t mean “good” (though it does mean “better”). Eating more green foods is a simple strategy to feel full on fewer calories and stick to your calorie target.       


NEXT
 There's no need to cut out yellow and orange foods. Instead, we want you to enjoy them mindfully and in healthier portions. This a powerful way to develop a healthier relationship with these foods and allow them their rightful place in a balanced diet.           Next up, a pop quiz.   
 There are 31 calories in 1 cup of steamed broccoli (a green food), while there are 828 calories in 1 cup of almonds (an orange food). Are almonds bad for you?      
NEXT
A. Yes, they have 27 times more calories than broccoli.
B. No, but they do have 27 times more calories than broccoli.
 It’s    B. No, but they do have 27 times more calories than broccoli.    Just because almonds have high CD doesn’t mean they’re bad for you—it only means you need to pay attention to the portion size. On the flip side, since broccoli has so few calories, you can really go to town.       
 Orange foods have:      
NEXT
A. High caloric density.
B. Low caloric density.
C. Grape-like properties.
 It’s    A. High caloric density.    But it doesn't mean you can’t eat orange foods. They’re neither bad nor good, and they’re often extremely delicious. You just need to be careful about how much of them you eat.       
 What percentage of your diet should consist of green foods?      
NEXT
A. 30%
B. 50%
C. 70%
 It’s    A. 30%      .    Of course, you can aim higher, but it’s not necessary—eating 50% green foods would be great, but it’s tough to do and even harder to maintain. It’s better to aim for something you can reach daily and keep up with in the long run. Remember: At the end of the day, it’s all about setting realistic targets that are sustainable long-term.

 Got some wrong? Don’t worry about it.                    Every time you log a food, Noom will let you know whether it’s orange, yellow, or green.    After a while, you’ll get to know which foods are which. Soon, you’ll be making healthier decisions and losing weight faster.           Check out some examples of foods in each of the categories, so you can start to wrap your head around it all:

SEE MY COLOR BREAKDOWN


NEXT
 We know there’s a lot to learn about Noom when you start this journey. And not to add even more to your (metaphorical) plate, but starting today you’ll see something new in your Noom experience.                  On the homepage, towards the top, you’ll now see a calorie range called the       Weight Loss Zone.       When you log your meals, the calories will track against your Weight Loss Zone.           <embed alt="Weight Loss Zone" embedtype="image" format="left" id="8955"/>                                                 Your Weight Loss Zone represents a calorie range that’s unique to you      .    There’s a lot of science and careful consideration that goes into setting this zone.            So, we wanted to break it down to help you understand how it's established and how you can eat to fuel your goals.   


NEXT
 We use your age, height, current weight, sex, and basic activity level to calculate the approximate number of calories your body uses in a day (your total daily energy expenditure, or TDEE), based on the Harris-Benedict equation.                     To lose weight, we have to expend more calories than we take in: what we call a caloric deficit.    We subtract how many calories you need to burn to lose weight from your TDEE—while also eating a healthy number of calories to keep your body functioning at its best—to create the Weight Loss Zone, which is a range of a few hundred calories.                  Eating closer to the lower end of the Weight Loss Zone typically leads to greater weight loss (about 2 pounds or ~1 kilogram lost per week), while eating at the higher end of the Weight Loss Zone typically leads to a more moderate weight loss (about 0.5 pounds or ~0.25 kilograms lost per week.)              Each day, we'll also adjust your calorie target based on your exercise    to fuel your activity while also working towards your weight loss goals. That’s why we add back half of the calories you burn through activity (as long as you log it in our exercise tracker function or you have a wearable device synced).    


NEXT
 We've homed in on giving you a calorie range rather than a precise number to hit because we know that not every day is the same. Consistently staying within your Weight Loss Zone each week is more important for building habits and reaching your weight loss goals than hitting an exact number each day.                     It’s important to note that you should be eating within the Weight Loss Zone—not below it.    Your body needs calories to function; even basic bodily functions like breathing and digestion require energy. Going below your zone can lead to headache, fatigue, a weakened immune system, and it can slow down your metabolism. Plus, it isn't sustainable in the long-term.            If you're new to tracking your calories, starting at the higher end of the Weight Loss Zone might feel like a more flexible and realistic place to start. As you start logging your meals consistently, you'll gain more confidence in staying within your range.   


NEXT
    All of that said, your Weight Loss Zone calorie range is a recommendation.    You can adjust your calorie target in the 'Settings' tab in the side menu if that is more aligned for you and your goals, like if you are going through any of the below life circumstances.   When to adjust your calorie target:    
 If you're lactating, talk to your doctor before embarking on any type of weight loss plan. It's generally recommended to eat at least 500-1000 more calories per day while lactating. Please note that calorie needs often vary based on lactation intensity, so consult with a doctor to find the right calorie goal for you. (Note: You're not allowed to join Noom if you’re pregnant.)   
You’re lactating:
 If you’re regularly feeling hungry after reaching your calorie goal for the day, we recommend starting by adding about 100 to 200 calories (or a small snack) to your calorie goal and seeing how you feel.   
You’re hungry:
 If a doctor, registered dietitian, or other qualified healthcare provider has recommended a specific calorie goal to support your health, we recommend adjusting your target accordingly.    
You have guidance from a healthcare professional:
        If you adjust your calorie goal, you'll have a designated number to hit each day rather than a Weight Loss Zone calorie range.        <ul><li>Note: To keep your body functioning at its best, Noom won’t let females adjust their goal below 1,200 to 1,320 calories per day, and males below 1,400 to 1,540 calories per day.   </li></ul>    


DONE
To recap, the Weight Loss Zone is:    <ul><li>Based on research and clinical recommendations for healthy weight loss.   </li><li>Personalized for each person.   </li><li>A recommendation that you should aim to meet (at minimum!).   </li><li>Can be adjusted manually at any time.   </li></ul> Now you know a little more about how and why we ask you to track your calories. As you learn more about your body, your hunger cues, and more, you'll become even more in touch with how much your body needs to reach your goals and feel satisfied. This will set you up for success on the Noom program and beyond—we’re rooting for you!

Create your motivation SOS plan

SOS?
 Motivation isn’t constant.                    Some days, you jump out of bed for a morning run. Others, you can barely drag yourself out for a cup of coffee.       Your best defense against these motivational dips is an SOS plan.    Your motivation SOS plan will be another tool for long-term success.                 In fact, we see that    Noomers who set up an SOS plan are three times more likely to reach their goal weight.               


NEXT
 A motivation SOS plan has three parts:       <ol><li>The warning sign.</li><li>The danger zone.</li><li>The reaction.</li></ol>


NEXT
1. The warning sign This describes what you do (or don’t do) when your motivation starts to dwindle. You might:   <ul><li>Skip weighing yourself in the morning.</li><li>Miss logging your lunch.</li><li>Leave your Noom lessons incomplete.</li></ul>


NEXT
2. The danger zone This identifies how you know the warning sign is a problem.        For example, you may forget a single weigh-in if you snooze your alarm one too many times (it happens). But if you miss it three times in a row, this might be a warning sign that there’s something deeper going on.          


NEXT
3. The reaction This is the type of action you’ll take to prevent yourself from a full derail.       Either you can initiate this action (if you’re extremely self-aware), or your coaching team can get the ball rolling (for a little extra support and accountability).       Here are some sample reactions:   <ul><li>Your support team at Noom sends you a text message to check in.</li><li>A friend reaches out to help you get back on track.</li></ul>


LET’S GO
 Putting the warning sign, danger zone, and reaction all together, here are some examples of motivation SOS plans at work.   Example #1 Warning sign: I don’t log any of my day’s meals.    Danger zone: I skip three days in a row.        Reaction: I update my meal reminders to help make logging easier.    Example #2 Warning sign: I don’t complete my Noom lessons.       Danger zone: I don’t open Noom for two days.    Reaction: The Noom team will send me a motivating text so I’m excited to come back.       Now let’s create your SOS plan.           
 To start, fill in the blanks.          Warning sign   : I know I’m falling off when…      
NEXT
A. I didn't complete any of my daily lessons.
B. I didn't log any of my day’s meals.
C. I didn’t open Noom.

    Danger zone   : I’m in the danger zone if this happens  ____ day(s) in a row.   
NEXT
A. 1
B. 2
C. 3

    Reaction   : When this happens, Noom should:   
NEXT
A. Send me a text message.
B. Send me an email.
C. Do nothing—I’ll take action myself. (Note: Noom users who pick text or email are more likely to achieve their goal weight).

I COMMIT
 Nice work!       You’re about to be equipped with the ultimate plan for whenever you’re nearing the danger zone. All you need to do is say “I commit,” and we’ll turn it on.        (Fun fact: Simply saying you commit to something can help you feel more accountable. It’s psychology.)          
I COMMIT
Hey. How are you?

WHICH IS...?
        No, really…how are you doing?                  Stressed? (Been there.)                 We wish we could take all your stress away, but we’re merely humble psychologists. We don’t have magic powers (yet).           So while we can’t solve all the problems outside of your control, we can help you focus on one thing you can control.   


NEXT
Your breath    Have you ever thought about it? It’s probably one of the most fascinating bodily functions: involuntary yet not, controlled by conscious thought while also occurring without it.       A lot of research has been done on the power of breath work to manage stress. We’ll save you the reading, but in summary, it works.       So, we have three breath work exercises for you.    


NEXT
For your body: Falling-out breath    This one’s great for releasing physical tension in your body.   <ol><li>Take a deep breath in, filling your lungs as much as possible.</li><li>At the top of your breath, take one more sip of air.</li><li>Exhale with a big, out-loud sigh (something like “HHHAAAAA”) as you release all the air.</li></ol>


NEXT
For your mind: Box breath    This one can help increase your mindfulness.   <ol><li>Inhale to the count of four. </li><li>Hold your breath at the top to the count of four. </li><li>Exhale to the count of four. </li><li>Hold your breath at the bottom to the count of four.</li></ol>


NEXT
For your self: Emptying breath    This can activate your parasympathetic nervous system and calm your sympathetic nervous system. In other words, it can help you and your body take it all down a notch.           1. Inhale to the count of three.    2. Exhale slowly to the count of six, releasing as much air as you can.   


DONE
 Time to DIY             
Why read about breathing when you can just do it? Choose one to try:
Please select a breathing exercise.
A. Falling-out breath.
B. Box breath.
C. Emptying breath.
                 Now set your timer for 1 minute and breathe.                    Your breath has just become a new tool for whenever you feel stressed.

YOU CAN SAY THAT AGAIN
 The renewed sense of hope, optimism, and opportunity that comes with the new year is the motivation many people need to get started.            But at the end of the day, this motivation can be quick to fade. (That's why we had you set up your SOS plan, after all.)           One of the most common times for motivation to fade is when we experience a slip. And let's face it—slips are inevitable this time of year!   


NEXT
 Going over your calorie budget, falling short of your water goal, a scale that won't budge—these are just some of the slips that cause a dip in most people's motivation.              "Why's that?" you might ask.      


ALL TOO FAMILIAR...
    You failed.                    Well, actually, you didn't fail—you *think* you failed.     As humans, we’re really,    really    hard on ourselves. So whenever we experience a misstep, we're quick to tell ourselves lies:      <ul><li>    "I've failed."      </li><li>    "I'll never reach my goal."      </li><li>    "I'm not made for this."      </li></ul> Sound familiar?   


NEXT
 Psychologists call these lies    "thought distortions"    (you'll learn more about these later).       And with the pressure of the new year and everyone telling us what we ought to eat, how we should exercise, and how we need to look, these    thought distortions get extra, extra loud   .       Fortunately,    we have lots of tricks up our sleeves to battle these thought distortions—   tricks we've coined    Psych Tricks.   


NEXT
Psych Trick: I've failed → I've learned    You're not failing, you're learning.        Every setback is an    opportunity    to learn about your thoughts, your triggers, your strengths, and your challenges. Most importantly, it's an opportunity to see where you've grown and where you might need to focus more of your effort going forward.       So whenever you think to yourself "I've failed!" or "I can't do this!" your job is to instead identify what this situation taught you (lemons → lemonade).           <embed alt="try" embedtype="image" format="fullwidth" id="7415"/>      


GOT IT!
 Let's try it on, shall we?        Think back to a time where you thought to yourself "I've failed." (And don't tell us this hasn't happened… you're human, after all!).        Now, identify at least one thing you learned from this experience.       Got it in mind?   


DONE
 Not only can "failure" lead to learning something new, but it can also lead to a positive change.            So keep this Psych Trick in mind as you continue your journey with Noom. The more you view your setbacks as opportunities to learn, the better you'll be set up for success.            Don't give up on us—and we won't give up on you.

Permission to not be perfect

PROGRESS > PERFECTION
 <embed alt="sx82stickynote2" embedtype="image" format="fullwidth" id="6447"/>    Read that 10 times over. Really, 10 times. (It’s a nice mantra, and if you find one you like, make sure to hold on to it.)                 It's easy to get caught up in the perfectionism trap. But focusing so hard on being perfect prevents us from taking action or making any progress at all.                  So forget perfection—it’s not the pathway to success.                  You’re going to miss your calorie budget. You’re going to fall short of your goals. You’re going to gain a pound (or two). You’re going to lose it again.            You’re incredible, but you’re also human. So take it easy on yourself, okay?

The story behind a habit

I’M LISTENING
 What do you think of when you hear the word "habit?" Is it brushing your teeth? Biting your nails? Midnight snacking?               Habits can seem fairly obvious, but they’re not always so clear-cut. For example, showering is a habit. So is toweling off afterward. Driving home on a certain route is a habit, and so is eating popcorn at the movies.    


NEXT
 Habits can feel like such an ingrained and automatic part of us, it’s as if we were born with them. But the truth is, all habits are learned.            And the best way to begin unlearning a habit is by understanding the subconscious process behind it.   


NEXT
Trigger → Thought → Action → Consequence    Psychologists call the subconscious process behind a habit the       behavior chain      —your first foray into    Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)   , which you'll continue to get to know throughout your journey.       Every habit is born out of a specific context. (I’m going to shower, better grab a towel.) In the behavior chain, it’s called a trigger.       There are infinite triggers, but they all fall under the categories of environmental, mental, emotional, or social.           


NEXT
 Let’s say you walk into a party and spot a beautiful cheese plate. That’s an    environmental trigger   .                  You look around, and all the guests are downing Brie like there’s no tomorrow. That’s your    social trigger   .       You’re overwhelmed by the number of people in the room and stressed about all the small talk you’re about to make. Meet your    mental and emotional triggers   .        


NEXT
 After the trigger comes a (subconscious) thought.                  Thoughts can be great, but can also say things like, "You’re at a party, have a good time!" or "All your friends are eating, why aren’t you?" or "Today was the worst, you deserve a mouthful of cheese just for making it through."          These thoughts lead to actions.    Actions like reaching out your hand, snatching the last piece of Gouda, and tossing it into your mouth before your brain has a chance to think, "Wait! I meant to eat the Brie."      


LET’S GO
 In turn,    actions lead to consequences.    There are four distinct types: physical, physiological, psychological, and emotional.       In our Gouda example, the consequences might be:   <ul><li>A not-so-happy stomach (physical).</li><li>Salivating for more Gouda (physiological).</li><li>Wondering, "Why did I do that?" (psychological).</li><li>Feeling confused or underwhelmed (emotional).  </li></ul>        Now let’s take a look at one of your unhelpful habits and map out the behavior chain behind it.           
Since it’s your first time, would you rather:
NEXT
A. Pick from a list of common habits, thoughts, and triggers.
B. Write your own habits, thoughts, and triggers.



NEXT
My unhelpful habit is…
Please enter an unhelpful habit (e.g., snacking late at night).
Overeating.
Skipping, avoiding, or “forgetting” the gym.
Hitting the fridge after a long day.
Grazing the snack table at a party.
Ordering takeout instead of cooking at home.
Eating sweets during coffee breaks.
Snacking late at night.


NEXT
 Before you are:   
what thought do you have?
Please enter your thought (e.g., "I earned these snacks.").
My friend or family will be offended if I don't eat X, Y, or Z.
I’ll go to the gym tomorrow.
I can’t be bothered to make food.
I deserve it or I’ve been “good” all day or week.
Everyone else does X, Y, Z. Why can’t I?
I just can’t resist.
This will help me feel better.


NEXT
What triggers this thought?
Please enter your trigger (e.g., tempting pretzels).
Hunger—emotional or physical.
Feeling tired or low-energy.
A stressful or emotional day.
Eating in social situations.

C. Walking is better than running.
D. None of the above.
E. All of the above.

A. Self-efficacy.
B. Self-determination.
C. Self-awareness.
D. Smug self-satisfaction.

Find your grATTITUDE

YOU'RE RIGHT
New year, new goals!       Are we right or are we right?              


WHAT IS IT?
 At the beginning of your journey, it's easy to focus on all the old habits you want to break, the new habits you want to build, and how far away you feel from YBP (Your Big Picture).        And let's be honest, at the end of the year, it's easy to rehash the doom and gloom from the last 12 months—the obstacles, the struggles, and everything you    could    be doing but aren't.      Fortunately, we have the antidote...


NEXT
The Noom Mindset—or what    non-Noomers    call gratitude.     We're not just calling it the    Noom Mindset    because we like making up Noom-isms or tooting our own horn, but because most people have a really hard time with "gratitude."          
 It's not that everyone's ungrateful. It's that gratitude has become something that feels old and stale for a lot of people, and often hard to connect with.           At the same time, science tells us that gratitude leads to…
NEXT
A. Greater optimism and sense of meaning.
B. Improved sleep.
C. Increased happiness and fewer feelings of depression.
D. Improved romantic relationships and friendships.
E. All of the above.
    It's E. All of the above.               Like we've said, your health is about a whole lot more than food and exercise. And studies show that practicing gratitude can increase your overall sense of wellbeing in as little as one week!   


NEXT
 Take a moment and pause.          
What's one thing you're grateful for in this moment?
Please share one thing you're grateful for!
(Share one thing you're grateful for)
           It can be anything—a warm cup of coffee, waking up before your alarm, how cute your cat looked this morning—literally anything!

 That's what we call    vanilla gratitude    (the most basic version of gratitude) and it's as simple as    naming at least 1 thing you're grateful for each day    (or 3 if you're in it for brownie points!).        We have 3 other options you might consider.              
To help us find the perfect option for you, tell us: Which of the following feels the MOST enjoyable for you? 
Please tell us which of the following sounds most enjoyable for you!
Enjoying an experience with a loved one.
Taking a walk in the fresh air.
Documenting every milestone (no matter how small!) on my journey.


DONE
Spread your gr-ATTITUDE           Fact: Gratitude can be multiplied   .           It's easy to take for granted things that we're used to. Sharing helps you reconnect with your appreciation.               Lend someone your favorite book, share a favorite meal or recipe with a family member, forward an inspiring podcast to a friend, take a hike together along your favorite trail, or treat them to coffee at your favorite local shop.                  While you continue to be a goal-getter, we also want you to keep on savoring your journey and finding appreciation for where you are right now.

Take a Gratitude Walk        Gratitude while reaching your step goal? Yes, please!               Take a walk and make note of 5 things you're grateful for   —   t      he smell of fresh flowers when you pass the flower shop, the width of the sidewalk that gives you the space to move freely, or the person that you always seem to pass along this path.

Start a Gratitude Jar               Each day, write down 3 things you're grateful for on small, individual pieces of paper and put those in a jar.               Try to be super specific.    For example, "I'm grateful for my partner listening to me today when I expressed feeling overwhelmed," or "I appreciate having lunch outside while taking a break from work."                  Bonus:    Throughout the week, whenever you're feeling low, pull out one of these pieces of paper to remind yourself of the goodness in your life.

        You’re on a roll! Let’s keep all this momentum going by building your self-confidence.                  Celebrating your own success—no matter how small—builds major confidence. Since we’re all about pushing you outside your comfort zone, we want you to celebrate not one but two wins. Even if it feels a little (or a lot) awkward.

Welcome to Noom 102

Next
 Congratulations! Nice work with your first mini-course. Now that you understand the psychology of weight loss, it's time to start solidifying your nutrition knowledge.   Noom 102: Food Fundamentals I              This mini-course takes an average of three to four days to complete. It’s the first of a three-part series about the factors that determine what, when, and how much you eat—from the biological and social, to the psychological and practical.                    By the end of this course, you’ll have identified the type of eater you are and the type of eater you want to be—and you’ll have gained a few tools to start getting there.    (Yep, it’s all starting to come together.)           Ready to do this?   
LET'S GO
Some inspiration
IT’S A DEAL
IT’S A DEAL
 It’s okay, you can say it.    You still have doubts about whether Noom’s going to work.                        You might be thinking:    Is this time really going to be different? Is achieving YBP really possible?                    We get it. But you have our word: We’re in this for the long haul, if you are, too.                  You might have reservations, but so does everyone when they’re starting something big.        Now’s not the time to give up or worry or wonder what might go wrong.    From now on, you shouldn’t doubt anything—except your limits.                 <embed alt="day4-welcomeB.png" embedtype="image" format="left" id="3917"/>                    
IT’S A DEAL
Overcome your thought distortions

ASK AWAY
 Believe it or not,    the toughest obstacles you’ll face on your journey are of your own making      .    Your (pretty amazing) brain plays all sorts of tricks on you, including    thought distortions.           Fortunately, you    can    overcome thought distortions—by learning to recognize them. Answer some questions to see what we mean.   
 True or false? "If I have a donut for breakfast, my day is ruined."      
NEXT
A. True
B. False

 True or false? "People will think it’s strange if I order a salad."      
NEXT
A. True
B. False

 True or false? "Other weight-loss programs haven’t worked for me, so Noom won’t, either."      
NEXT
A. True
B. False



A-HA
 The previous true-or-false statements are examples of lies we tell ourselves. Luckily, reality is far less harsh—a treat won’t ruin your day, people aren’t thinking about your salad, and past attempts to be healthier won’t affect your success with Noom.                 These are just    thought distortions—tricks our minds use to convince us of (usually negative) things that aren’t actually true      .                      Remember that behavior chain—the way we form habits?    (Trigger → Thought → Action → Consequence)       Well, thought distortions can affect our actions. For example, if you think,    I'll never be able to change how I eat   , you might go back for seconds even if you’re not hungry.      


NEXT
 Since the best way to overcome thought distortions is to identify them, here are some common types of distorted thinking:   All-or-nothing thinking     Classifying things as falling into only one of two categories; thinking in extremes.           I'll never be able to change how I eat.      Mind reading     Assuming what others think.           People will think I’m strange if I order a salad instead of ramen.      Unhelpful rules     Following strict rules that run counter to your goals.           I must finish all the food on my plate.      Labeling    Reducing something to a single characteristic or descriptor.           Orange foods are bad.      Fortune-telling    Predicting the future.           If I blow my calorie budget today, I won’t lose weight this week.      Exaggerated thinking    Making a situation into something bigger than it is.           I had a chocolate croissant for breakfast, so my day is ruined.      


DONE
 Noom Novices experience lots of distorted thinking. Often, they want to do everything perfectly. They’re afraid that one little mistake will derail all their hard work.                  So if you find yourself thinking:    If I miss a day or two of Noom, I’ll forget everything I’ve learned.              Guess what? That’s a thought distortion.        We knew your brain might play this trick. After all, it’s a pretty common one. Luckily, this thought is totally false. You can rewind your course a week, a few weeks, or a few months.    All you have to do is ask your guide or your 1:1 coach. And they won’t judge—trust us, they’ve seen it all.

The four eating habits

NEXT
 Have you ever thought about how you eat—and why you eat that way?                     There are four different types of eating habits, and everyone engages in at least one of them.    We’re going to break down all four of them, so you can decide which one best reflects your own eating habits.                 The final goal? To    help you find a healthy balance that works for you—for good.               It’s like a personality test, but for eating. The best kind of test. (At least we think so.)   


NEXT
#1: Fuel eating      Fuel eating gives your body what it needs to power you through the day   —vegetables, fruits, whole grains, lean proteins, healthy fats. Fuel eaters eat to live, rather than live to eat.


NEXT
#2: Fun eating      Fun eating is when you eat for pleasure.    Think of delicious and comforting foods like gelato, samosas, and cheese enchiladas. One rule of thumb: If it’s double-stuffed, it’s probably a fun food. (Unless it’s double-stuffed with spinach.) Opposite of fuel eaters, fun eaters live to eat.


NEXT
#3: Fog eating, aka mindless eating      When you’re fog eating, you don't even realize you’re eating; you eat mindlessly.    Think popcorn at the movies, peanut butter-stuffed pretzels while you work, or stale crackers while you stand in front of the fridge staring off into space. (Oh, and Gouda at that party when you meant to eat Brie.)


NEXT
#4: Storm eating      Storm eating is when you eat and feel like you can’t stop, even if you’re not hungry.    This often happens when you get your hands on foods you consider off-limits—like when you stumble across an open bag of chocolate-covered macadamia nuts in the kitchen when no one is around.
 Now for the fun part. Let’s analyze your personal eating style.      Everyone engages in different eating habits at one time or another, but which is yours most of the time?
NEXT
A. Fuel eating.
B. Fun eating.
C. Fog eating.
D. Storm eating.



GOT IT
 That’s great!    A balanced approach to eating should be centered around fuel eating: choosing foods that help your body function and feel its best.    Just don’t forget to incorporate some fun foods into your diet. After all, you want a healthy routine you can stick with for life.   


GOT IT
 Good!    Eating fun foods is an important part of a balanced approach to eating.    (Also, yum.) But since many fun foods are yellow or orange, they should be eaten in moderation. Over time, we’ll work toward helping you center your day around fuel eating so your body works and feels its best. And don’t worry, there will always be room for fun foods you love to eat. (Hello, shrimp tempura.)   


GOT IT
 Fog eating’s a tough one to overcome. (And incredibly common. Who hasn’t spaced out over a bowl of cereal or three?) But that’s where our Psych Tricks come in. Together, you won’t just change    what    you eat, but    how    you do it.    Mindful eating is one strategy that can help you eat smarter.       


GOT IT
 Storm eating? We’ve all been there. While tough to overcome, our Psych Tricks are designed to help you make it through the rain.    Focus on eating a mix of fuel and fun foods, and you’ll find storm eating will decrease and ultimately disappear.    Try to avoid labeling foods as “good” and “bad,” if you can. Instead, think of them as foods to eat more of (green foods) and foods to eat in moderation (yellow and orange foods). Eventually, the storm will pass. (No degree in meteorology required.)   
GOT IT


TELL ME MORE!
   We're going to make a bold statement: New Year's Resolutions don't work.        For the most part, resolutions focus on "quick fixes" that ask you to    radically    change your behaviors overnight—like going from 1 glass of water a day to 8, from exercising a few times a week to every day, or cutting out entire food groups in the name of "health."      So what if now, and for 2023, we start a    revolution, not a resolution   ?


BUT HOW?
 Here's the thing (and it's sort of revolutionary)...you already are the best version of yourself! Seriously.    You don’t need to be fixed.    You are already amazing.       It’s not pills, superfoods, or fad diets that will make the difference, but    building new healthy habits with small actions every day.            Changing your habits takes time.    And while it won't happen overnight, it doesn't have to be hard (no pain and suffering required).


A-HA!
        Enter: The secret to making new habits stick and your next psychology trick (PsychTrick for short).           PsychTrick: Habit stacking    Psychology tells us that the best way to build a new habit is to pair it with a habit you already have—   "habit stacking"    (a concept first introduced by James Clear, author of Atomic Habits).        Habit stacking follows this simple framework:            Before/After I    [insert existing habit here]   , I will    [insert new habit here]   .       Your    existing habit    acts as a buddy system for your    new habit    until your new habit can stand on its own two feet.   


MAKES SENSE
    Take for example some existing daily habits most of us have:    taking a shower, drinking a morning cup of joe, making our bed, checking our email, going to sleep, or scrolling social media.          Then take some daily habits many of us want to develop:    starting your day with your Noom lessons, making a healthy breakfast, taking a daily walk, practicing some breathing exercises you learned, or showing some gratitude.        With these in mind, you might stack one of the following:   <ul><li> After I make my morning cup of coffee, I'll read my Noom lessons.   </li><li> Before I check my email, I'll make a healthy breakfast.   </li><li> After I take my shower, I'll practice 1 minute of box breathing.   </li><li> Before I go to sleep, I will identify 3 things I'm grateful for.   </li></ul>


NEXT
 Now it's time to...   
Pick a current habit:
Please pick a habit you currently have!
Wake up
Make coffee or tea
Take a shower or bath
Check email
Go to sleep
Tell us a current habit you want to use to habit stack:
Please share a current habit!

Something else
              
And pair it with a habit you want to build:
Please choose a current habit!

Eat a healthy breakfast
Drink a glass of water
Take a walk
Do a workout
Tell us a new habit you want to build:

I COMMIT!
Now you've got a plan!        All that's left to do is to commit, because commitment increases action, and action leads to change.              Revolutionary, right?

Flashback to consolidation                 Remember    consolidation   ? It’s the process of converting short-term memory into long-term memory.    It’s also what happens when you combine your underwear and sock drawers.           Both are useful activities, but the first is a Psych Trick that will help you lock in everything you’ve learned since day one. So prepare to consolidate—via quiz, but of course.   
 1. Green foods are:      
NEXT
A. High in fat.
B. Low in caloric density.
C. Low in water.
D. High in atoms.
E. Pasture-raised.
 It’s    B. Low in caloric density.    Green foods are high in water and nutrients, helping you feel full on fewer calories. (Foods like vegetables, fruits, and whole grains.)      
 2. To weigh yourself accurately, avoid doing it…       
NEXT
A. Every day.
B. On a Tuesday.
C. Using different scales.
D. On an empty stomach.
 It’s    C. Using different scales.    Weighing yourself on an empty stomach, every morning, is the best way to lose weight and stay accountable. Since your weight fluctuates based on a number of factors, including the scale you’re using, always weigh yourself with the same scale.   
 3. In the behavior chain, what comes directly before the “Action” (or behavior)?      
NEXT
A. Trigger
B. Thought
C. Consequence
D. Secrets
 It’s    B. Thought      .    The behavior chain goes like this: Trigger → Thought → Action → Consequence. Your thoughts are ultimately what control your actions. Control what you think, and you’ll take charge of what you do.   
 4. The term that describes how our minds can convince us of things that aren’t really true is:      
NEXT
A. Thought distortions.
B. Thought explosions.
C. Thought bubbles.
D. Is anything really true?
 It’s    A. Thought distortions      .    Whether anything is really true is probably a better question for a philosopher, and we’re really more about psychology in these parts. But, hey, let us know what you find out.      
 5. Which of the following describes eating without realizing it?    
NEXT
A. Fuel eating.
B. Fun eating.
C. Fog eating.
D. Storm eating.
E. Amnesia eating.
 It’s    C. Fog eating      .    Fog eating is another term for mindless eating. Examples: the risotto balls you absently pop into your mouth at a wedding, or the cheese puffs you snack on in front of the TV.

 This is Daniela. Over the course of 16 weeks, she lost more than 16 pounds with Noom.                 She told us:       “   I didn’t just learn how to lose weight, I learned how to keep it off.    I know how to prepare healthier meals at home. I know how to make healthy food choices when I’m out. I know how to stay motivated. I know how to overcome sabotaging thoughts. I know how to get back on track if I ever slip up.    It’s a lifestyle and it feels natural.   ”              <embed alt="day5-welcomeB.png" embedtype="image" format="left" id="3938"/>   


DONE
 Before joining Noom, Daniela was a self-professed skeptic. Here’s her best advice for other skeptics:                 “Tell yourself you’ll give it at least one month. Then it will all make sense. You’ll soon see your life beginning to change in ways you never believed possible.”               Just think: Right now, you’re in the process of writing your own success story. We know it’ll be a good one.

Conquer your cravings

NEXT
 Like many of us, you probably have a sweet tooth. And a salty tooth. Oh, and a savory tooth, too.                  Well, you weren’t born with these teeth.                    In fact, the taste for sweet, salty, and savory foods is an acquired one. Everyone’s predisposed to enjoy these foods, but it’s only over time that our bodies learn to crave petit fours, pizza, paletas, and pork rinds.              Luckily, anything you can learn, you can unlearn, too.   


NEXT
 Losing your sweet or salty or savory tooth will take time—and you’ll have to eat less salt, sugar, and unhealthy fats to get there.       While giving up rich foods entirely is no fun at all, learning to eat them in moderation is key. To do this, let’s conquer your all-day, everyday cravings with some healthy (and still delicious) swaps.   
 When it comes to cravings, what do you struggle with the most?   
NEXT
A. Baked goods: If it’s sweet and flaky, I want it.
B. Anything salty or crunchy: If it’s crackers, pretzels, or chips, I must have it.
C. Chocolate and candy: If it’s sugar, I simply cannot resist.
D. Comfort foods: If you’re talking French fries, pizza, or enchiladas, I can’t say no.
E. Don’t make me choose—I crave a few of these.

Savory swaps


DEAL
 So, maybe you tried a swap, and it didn’t quite scratch your itch. Sometimes, the best (and only) way to curb a craving is to satisfy it—in moderation, of course.       Remember, it’s okay to eat fun foods sometimes. We’re changing how you eat for life, and nobody can (or should have to) avoid birthday cake forever. It’s all about making little changes that you can actually sustain.            So make some swaps—but have some fun. Deal?

Make the most of your social triggers

SHOW ME HOW
    When it comes to breaking your behavior chain, you have lots of options.        You’ve already learned one way:    reframing your thinking to overcome your thought distortions.         Now we’ll talk about how you can    change your habits by changing your triggers.   


NEXT
 Like we’ve mentioned, triggers come in different shapes and sizes.    They can be environmental, mental, emotional, or social.             Social triggers are very common and can be challenging to change.    You’re not going to stop going to restaurants, attending family dinners, or celebrating milestones with food. But these triggers often lead to mindless eating. (Hello, breadbasket. And noodle kugel. And nian gao.)      But not all triggers are bad! In fact,    some are pretty helpful.    


NEXT
 They’re called (surprise!) positive social triggers. And they    encourage you to make food and activity choices that support your health goals   —and Your Big Picture. For example:   Healthy food offers When your partner cooks a healthy meal for the two of you, or a neighbor gives you fresh vegetables from their garden.   Compliments or praise Your yoga teacher tells you how much stronger you’ve become, or your family tells you how delicious your spaghetti squash Bolognese smells.   Other people’s habits When a friend asks you to join them for a walk in the evening, or you see your coworkers bring healthy leftovers for their lunches.           


NEXT
 Of course, there are negative social triggers, too.    These triggers can push you to make choices counter to your health goals.    Here are some examples:   Peer pressure When your partner brings a bowl of barbecue chips to the couch, or a friend pushes you to split a slice of tres leches cake when you’re already full.    Judgment Your in-law raises an eyebrow because you ordered a side salad instead of fries, or your roommate rolls their eyes when you say you’re headed to the gym.    Other people’s habits When you come home to your family lounging on the couch, or when your work spouse suggests getting fast food for lunch.          
 Take a moment to reflect on your day yesterday. What’s one social trigger you encountered?            Did a friend try to convince you to skip the gym for happy hour? Did a neighbor ask you to go for a walk at lunch? Did your partner pick up takeout on the way home from work? Or was it something else?             <hr/>        Great! Now that you’ve identified your social trigger, which type was it?   
NEXT
A. Positive social trigger.
B. Negative social trigger.



DONE
 Positive social triggers are excellent.    The key is to figure out how to make them permanent.           For example:   <ul><li>If your coworkers prepare nutritious lunches, ask to join them and exchange recipes. </li><li>If your friend invites you to a group fitness class, make it a weekly thing.</li><li>If your partner goes for a bike ride every morning, join them a few times a week. </li></ul>       Think of how you can make your positive triggers permanent, and then make it happen.             


DONE
 Negative triggers aren’t fun, but they’re great opportunities to grow.    Since social triggers are often unavoidable, the best approach is to make them work for you. Yes, you can turn a negative trigger into a more positive one.          For example:   <ul><li>If your coworkers invite you out for fast food, suggest a healthy but inexpensive restaurant instead.</li><li>If your friends want to hit happy hour, suggest a group workout class instead.</li><li>If your partner usually picks up takeout, suggest a healthy recipe to cook together at home.</li></ul>    Think of how you can turn that negative into a positive, and then make it happen.             
DONE
Make your habits stick with these 2 questions

GOT IT
 Can we let you in on a secret?       Setting small, daily goals is the key ingredient in setting goals that last beyond January.     The best daily goals are:   <ol><li>   Action-based:    The last few years have shown us that we    can't    always control the outcome, but we    can    control the actions we take.    For example, an outcome-based goal might be to walk 1.5 miles in 30 minutes. But your new    action-based goal    might be to walk 30 minutes—you can achieve the outcome over time.   </li><li>   Extra small:    Small steps add up, and taking small steps will make sure you don't run out of fuel.    Large goal: Walk for 60 minutes. Extra small goal: Walk for 10 minutes, and if you walk more, great!   </li></ol>


I LIKE THAT
Setting small,    daily    goals:<ol><li>   Increases your motivation:    Setting and achieving one goal every day increases your self-efficacy (that's your belief in your ability to succeed!).</li><li>   Helps you learn and pivot:    Your feedback loop is never more than 24 hours. So if your long-term aspiration is to eat more veggies and your first daily goal to “eat a salad for lunch” doesn’t work for you, you can pivot and set a goal to “add a side of roasted veggies at dinner” tomorrow. </li></ol>


TELL ME! TELL ME!
There are    tons    of small, daily goals you might consider as you're getting started:<ul><li>Drink a glass of water first thing in the morning.</li><li>Add a green food to your breakfast.</li><li>Walk for 10 minutes in the morning.</li><li>Swap your latte with a cup of tea. </li><li>Snack on a fruit or vegetable.</li><li>Stretch for 5 minutes during your lunch break.</li><li>Name 3 things you're grateful for.</li><li>Practice 1 minute of breathing exercises before bed.</li></ul>    With all these options, how do you choose a daily goal that's right for you?          


GOALS = ENJOYABLE + SUSTAINABLE
Ask yourself two questions: Is it enjoyable? Is it sustainable?   1 - Is it enjoyable? Weight loss doesn't need to involve pain and suffering (that's a thought distortion).    Your goals should feel fun and exciting   , like making a healthier (but equally delicious!) version of your favorite comfort food, sipping on your favorite herbal tea to help you hit your water goal, or dancing around your living room to your favorite playlist to get some exercise in.      2 - Is it sustainable?Sustainability is the name of Noom's game. That's why we don't encourage setting goals like eliminating pasta or never snacking. While those might work in the short term, they simply aren't sustainable for most people. So    if you can't see yourself doing something once you've graduated Noom, we don't want you doing it now.   


Next
 There are    countless    examples of people achieving their goals early and burning out in a few weeks.        Why? Their goals usually aren't enjoyable or sustainable.        We're    not    saying that you'll be    so    excited to go for a walk every day or counting down the minutes until you snack on grapes, but    if your daily goals don't feel enjoyable or sustainable in    some    way most days, there's got to be another way.           Because we're in it for the long haul. And we're in it for the revolution.            Most importantly,    we're in it together!             
CONTINUE THE REVOLUTION!
Can you guess...

IS THIS A TRICK QUESTION?
 ...what we love even more than talking?   


NEXT
 Action. In particular,    taking small steps every day towards building new habits   . (Because that's how you start your revolution, remember?)       So now it's time to take a step forward and integrate 3 of Noom's key philosophies:   <ol><li>    Your journey should be sustainable AND enjoyable.      </li><li>    No foods are off limits in moderation!       </li><li>    Sometimes the best way to kick a craving is to honor it.       </li></ol> How?       Treat yourself to one serving of a fun food today.       A handful of peppermint bark. A mug of eggnog. A small slice of apple pie. Or any other delicious food or drink you enjoy!         PS: In the future, we're going to explore tons of ways for you to treat yourself beyond food, like investing in some practical self-care or taking a mental health break. But today's the day to enjoy your favorite edible treat!    
HOORAY!
Managing whole health

SHOW ME
 We’ve talked a lot about weight loss and food swaps and cravings. And that stuff’s important, for sure.                     You know what else is important? The rest of you.    At Noom, we believe that taking care of your thoughts and feelings is just as important as taking care of your physical body.               But how? Well, we’ve got some ideas on habits that can promote "whole body" health. Nine, to be exact.   


NEXT
 1.    Spend some time outdoors each day.    Nature is the superfood of environments, boasting benefits from increased positive emotions and an improved sense of health and well-being.            2.    Take a time-out.    Whenever you find yourself feeling overwhelmed by your health goals, or with anything in life, take a step away. Oftentimes, 1 minute is all you need to feel less overwhelmed and to regroup and refocus.   


NEXT
 3.    Journal.    Spend a few minutes putting your thoughts and feelings on paper to clear your mind, process your experiences, and make room for good thoughts (like "Look at me, I’m journaling!").       4.    Create positive experiences.    Make time for the little things that make you happy, like time with pets, people-watching, listening to a comedy podcast, or reading some fiction.    


NEXT
 5.    Set boundaries.    Pay attention to how much news you take in and who you spend time with—and how they make you feel. Consider cutting back on your social media use, or setting up designated times during the day to check in on the current state of affairs. And when conversations come up that feel overwhelming, try saying, “I’d love to talk about something else right now, please!” (Or just leave—that works, too!)      6.    Reach out.    Our individual experiences are unique, but we’re all in this together. Check in on your friends to see how they’re doing, and ask for their support when you need it. (And, of course, we’re always here for you.)


NEXT
 7.    Reevaluate your goals.    Goals change over time based on our priorities, our life circumstances, and the times we’re living in—and that’s okay. Based on where you are mentally, emotionally, and physically, you may choose to prioritize getting good sleep instead of getting up early to exercise. Or you might focus on finding healthy meals to go instead of meal prepping yourself.            8.    Tell yourself you’ve got this.    Have a go-to affirmation you can tell yourself when you’re struggling (or even when life’s going great). Something like “I am strong” or “I can do hard things” or “I’m doing the best I can” or “I am truly the coolest.”           9.    Just show up.    Life is unpredictable, and having a few constants is crucial. So keep showing up to Noom every single day, even if it’s just to message your coaching team, log a meal, or complete a few lessons. Best of all, you can always show up as you are—no judgment, shame, or guilt here. We’re just happy to see your face.   


I’VE GOT THIS
 Working toward Your Big Picture isn’t easy. You’re doing something challenging, so show yourself some grace along the way. You don’t need to make your life any harder than it already is.        Now, place your right hand on your left shoulder, your left hand on your right shoulder, and squeeze tight. That felt good, right?        You’ve got this. We promise.

 And just like that,    you’re more than halfway through Noom 102 and over 85% of the way to reaching Noom Apprentice      .                     Reaching Noom Apprentice is no small feat. Seriously.                  Changing your habits is hard, and many people drop out at the hint of challenge—but you didn’t.                  While we’re all for living in the moment, we also believe that anticipation is the secret to happiness. In fact,    studies in positive psychology show that people actually feel happier before a significant event (like a vacation) than during or after it      .    (Unless you’re packing for a toddler, that is.)           So close your eyes and picture yourself eight lessons from now. You’re almost there. Feels good, doesn’t it?

Maybe you:   <ul><li>Work out for 5 more minutes.</li><li>Swap your second cup of coffee (or your fifth) for a glass of water.</li><li>Add one extra vegetable to your lunch every day.</li></ul>              Each night, take a moment to plan a new healthy step you can try the following morning.            What will you add tomorrow? Think about it—then do it!

Set a SMART goal

WHAT IS IT?
 Have you ever set a lofty goal, only to fall short of achieving it? That's a rhetorical question—we all have. We're human, after all.                  When this happens, how often have you thought "my goal must have been too big. I guess I didn't want it enough. I'll never achieve anything." (Hello again,       thought distortions      .)           Aside from your thought distortions being unhelpful, they're also untrue—we often can't reach our goals because we're not sure where to start or where to end. Bummer, we know.           The good news is that we have an effective strategy to help you set goals    and    make sure you'll achieve them.   


NEXT
 To help you define a goal and create an effective plan to achieve it, remember the acronym SMART.        A SMART goal is:   <ul><li>   Specific   : Clearly defined and detailed.</li><li>   Measurable   : Easy to determine whether it’s achieved or not.</li><li>   Attainable   : Something you can accomplish with effort and consistency (like taking Sundays to meal plan for the week) as opposed to something not realistic (like mapping out every single meal you'll eat for the next 6 months, down to the pat of butter on your baked potato).</li><li>   Relevant   : Aligned with your other goals.</li><li>   Time-based   : Linked to a time frame.</li></ul> Setting SMART goals is one of the most popular strategies for psychologically sound goal setting.    That’s because they help people both define and accomplish their goals.       


NEXT
 Your SMART goals should also reveal    how you will achieve the goal      .    You know, the exact way you’ll get from where you are to where you want to be.          
    Typically, short-term goals should be achieved in one to four weeks, while long-term goals can take months or even years.           Setting several consecutive short-term goals will help you accomplish your long-term goals.   
A little about the “T,” for time-based:
 Let’s say you currently eat dessert every night, and your goal is to give it up entirely (except for when you're truly in the mood for it). That would be a long-term goal, since it’s unrealistic to expect to break a habit like that in just a few weeks.        So your short-term SMART goal could be to limit yourself to a dessert every other day, or four desserts total per week. It might look like this:      “I will limit myself to four desserts (   Specific   ,    Measurable   ) per week (   Attainable   ,    Relevant   ) for a duration of three weeks (   Time-based   ) by replacing my dessert on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday with a cup of herbal tea or a glass of sparkling water (   how you will do it   ).”
Want to see a real-life example of a SMART goal?
 Now it’s time to set your own SMART goal.           Based on what you’ve learned so far, pick one of the following areas that you want to work on. (If none of these fit your long-term goal, consider this a trial run.)   
NEXT
A. Nutrition: I want to eat more green foods.
B. Psychology: I want to respond differently to my trigger.
C. Exercise: I want to increase my step count.



NEXT
 So you want to eat more green foods? Great goal—let’s make it SMART.                    Fill in the blanks:       “Next week, I will add _____(number) green food(s) to _____ (number) meal(s) on at least ______ (number) days by looking up green foods on Noom’s food database.”           If you want to take it easy, just use the number one for each of the spaces. If you want to be ambitious, try for two or three. If you want to go wild, aim for four.   
 So, how will you add more green foods to your day?   
NEXT
A. Use a lettuce wrap for my sandwich instead of a tortilla or bun.
B. Add a handful of spinach to my fruit smoothie.
C. Snack on homemade kale chips instead of regular chips.
D. Add vegetables to my scrambled eggs.
E. Swap full-fat yogurt with low-fat yogurt.
F. Add chopped vegetables to my pasta sauce.
G. Eat a bowl of fruit instead of candy.
H. Replace a baked potato with steamed vegetables.
I. Use a different trick.



NEXT
 So you want to respond differently to a trigger? Great goal—let’s make it SMART.                    Fill in the blank:          “Next week, I will respond differently to my trigger by exposing myself to this negative trigger _____(number) time(s) and having a plan to respond in a healthier way.”             If you want to take it easy, just use the number one. If you want to be ambitious, try for two or three. If you want to go wild, aim for seven.    
 Imagine your trigger is when your partner brings home takeout.           How will you respond differently to your trigger?   
NEXT
A. Do a cost analysis: Think about the costs of saying no—maybe you’ll feel like you’re missing out. Think about the costs of saying yes—perhaps you’ll feel weak for giving in. Which one feels more taxing? Recognizing the costs can help you say no more confidently.
B. Simply say “No, thank you.": You might need to say this over and over—almost like a broken record. This can be tough, but with practice you can become a pro at no.
C. Be assertive: Being polite (yet firm) will leave no room for interpretation or further pushing.
D. Give a reason: Providing an excuse like “I’m not hungry” or “I’ve already planned something else for my dinner” can help, too.
E. Disarm with humor: Make a joke, like “I’m allergic to takeout,” to deflect and make light of the situation.
F. Use a different trick.



NEXT
 So you want to increase your step count? Great goal—let’s make it SMART.                    Fill in the blanks:       “Next week, I will surpass my step goal by at least ______ (number) steps at least _____(number) day(s) by monitoring my pedometer, and moving my body accordingly.”          If you want to take it easy, just choose one for the number of days. If you want to be ambitious, try for two or three. If you want to go wild, aim for seven. As for the number of steps, choose at least 300 if you want to see that step count start rising.          
 So, how will you add more steps to your day?      
NEXT
A. Get climbing: Whenever possible, take the stairs.
B. Make it part of a break: Take a 15-minute walk during lunchtime.
C. Get up and move: Stand up and walk around for 1 minute every hour.
D. Hoof it: Walk to the store instead of driving.
E. Extend your commute: Get off a stop early when taking public transit.
F. Use a different trick.

 Now it’s time to set your own SMART goal.           Based on what you’ve learned so far, pick one of the following areas that you want to work on. (If none of these fit your long-term goal, consider this a trial run.)   
NEXT
A. Nutrition: I want to eat more green foods.
B. Psychology: I want to respond differently to my trigger.
C. Exercise: I want to increase my step count.



NEXT
 So you want to eat more green foods? Great goal—let’s make it SMART.                    Fill in the blanks:       “Next week, I will add _____(number) green food(s) to _____ (number) meal(s) on at least ______ (number) days by looking up green foods on Noom’s food database.”           If you want to take it easy, just use the number one for each of the spaces. If you want to be ambitious, try for two or three. If you want to go wild, aim for four.   
 So, how will you add more green foods to your day?   
NEXT
A. Use a lettuce wrap for my sandwich instead of a tortilla or bun.
B. Add a handful of spinach to my fruit smoothie.
C. Snack on homemade kale chips instead of regular chips.
D. Add vegetables to my scrambled eggs.
E. Swap full-fat yogurt with low-fat yogurt.
F. Add chopped vegetables to my pasta sauce.
G. Eat a bowl of fruit instead of candy.
H. Replace a baked potato with steamed vegetables.
I. Use a different trick.

 So you want to respond differently to a trigger? Great goal—let’s make it SMART.                    Fill in the blank:          “Next week, I will respond differently to my trigger by exposing myself to this negative trigger _____(number) time(s) and having a plan to respond in a healthier way.”             If you want to take it easy, just use the number one. If you want to be ambitious, try for two or three. If you want to go wild, aim for seven.    
 Imagine your trigger is when your partner brings home takeout.           How will you respond differently to your trigger?   
NEXT
A. Do a cost analysis: Think about the costs of saying no—maybe you’ll feel like you’re missing out. Think about the costs of saying yes—perhaps you’ll feel weak for giving in. Which one feels more taxing? Recognizing the costs can help you say no more confidently.
B. Simply say “No, thank you.”: You might need to say this over and over—almost like a broken record. This can be tough, but with practice you can become a pro at no.
C. Be assertive: Being polite (yet firm) will leave no room for interpretation or further pushing.
D. Give a reason: Providing an excuse like “I’m not hungry” or “I’ve already planned something else for my dinner” can help, too.
E. Disarm with humor: Make a joke, like “I’m allergic to takeout,” to deflect and make light of the situation.
F. Use a different trick.



NEXT
 So you want to increase your step count? Great goal—let’s make it SMART.                    Fill in the blanks:       “Next week, I will surpass my step goal by at least ______ (number) steps at least _____(number) day(s) by monitoring my pedometer, and moving my body accordingly.”          If you want to take it easy, just choose one for the number of days. If you want to be ambitious, try for two or three. If you want to go wild, aim for seven. As for the number of steps, choose at least 300 if you want to see that step count start rising.          
 So, how will you add more steps to your day?      
NEXT
A. Get climbing: Whenever possible, take the stairs.
B. Make it part of a break: Take a 15-minute walk during lunchtime.
C. Get up and move: Stand up and walk around for 1 minute every hour.
D. Hoof it: Walk to the store instead of driving.
E. Extend your commute: Get off a stop early when taking public transit.
F. Use a different trick.

Set a SMART goal

WHAT IS IT?
        Have you ever set a lofty goal, only to fall short of achieving it? That's a rhetorical question—we all have. We're human, after all.                  When this happens, how often have you thought "my goal must have been too big. I guess I didn't want it enough. I'll never achieve anything." (Hello again,       thought distortions      .)           Aside from your thought distortions being unhelpful, they're also untrue—we often can't reach our goals because we're not sure where to start or where to end. Bummer, we know.           The good news is that we have an effective strategy to help you set goals    and    make sure you'll achieve them.   


NEXT
 To help you define a goal and create an effective plan to achieve it, remember the acronym SMART.        A SMART goal is:   <ul><li>   Specific   : Clearly defined and detailed.</li><li>   Measurable   : Easy to determine whether it’s achieved or not.</li><li>   Attainable   : Something you can accomplish with effort and consistency (like taking Sundays to meal plan for the week) as opposed to something not realistic (like mapping out every single meal you'll eat for the next 6 months, down to the pat of butter on your baked potato).</li><li>   Relevant   : Aligned with your other goals.</li><li>   Time-based   : Linked to a time frame.</li></ul> Setting SMART goals is one of the most popular strategies for psychologically sound goal setting.    That’s because they help people both define and accomplish their goals.           


NEXT
 Your SMART goals should also reveal    how you will achieve the goal      .    You know, the exact way you’ll get from where you are to where you want to be.             
    Typically, short-term goals should be achieved in one to four weeks, while long-term goals can take months or even years.           Setting several consecutive short-term goals will help you accomplish your long-term goals.   
A little about the “T,” for time-based:
 Let’s say you currently drink a can of soda every day, and your goal is to give it up entirely. That would be a long-term goal, since it’s unrealistic to expect to break a habit like that in just a few weeks.        So your short-term SMART goal could be to limit yourself to one can of soda every other day, or four cans total per week. It might look like this:      “I will limit myself to four cans (   Specific   ,    Measurable   ) of soda per week (   Attainable   ,    Relevant   ) for a duration of three weeks (   Time-based   ) by replacing my can of soda on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday with a glass of sparkling water (   how you will do it   ).”

Break down your calorie range and fuel your goals

LET'S DO IT
 As you’ve noticed, Noom's food logging feature also includes a recommended calorie range that you should be aiming to meet each day.                    There’s a lot of science and careful consideration that goes into setting your specific goals.            So, we wanted to break it down to help you understand how it's set and explore how to make sure you're eating to fuel your goals.    


NEXT
 We use your age, height, current weight, sex, and basic activity level to calculate the approximate number of calories your body uses in a day (your total daily energy expenditure or TDEE), based on the Harris-Benedict equation.          
 Eating in a deficit of 500 calories per day will typically result in about one pound lost per week—research shows that this is a healthy caloric deficit to allow your body to function at its best while also losing weight. So, we subtract this from your TDEE to create your calorie target. We let you adjust this (within a healthy range) based on your goals—more on this soon!          
Remember: to lose weight, we have to expend more calories than we take in—what we call a caloric deficit. 
 When you burn energy through exercise, we recommend that you fuel your activity by consuming more calories. That's why Noom will add back about half of the number of calories you burn through activity (as long as you log it in the app or you have a wearable device synced).   
We also adjust your daily calorie target based on your activity level.


NEXT
 As you may have noticed, your calorie target includes a range of a couple hundred calories on either end. That’s because we want you to strive for progress, not perfection.                  How you eat isn’t going to be the same day-to-day. It’s not realistic to assume you'll hit that exact calorie target every day, and that's OK.           
 Noom sets your recommended calorie range for you based on the information you gave us about your sex, age, weight, and height, but you can manually adjust your total by clicking “settings” in the menu tab. If you have a set calorie number from a qualified healthcare provider, you can adjust the calorie target accordingly.            Or, if you're experiencing other lifestyle changes that require you to eat more calories, we recommend that you make that adjustment.       
That being said, you can adjust your calorie target if you’d like to. 
        Noom won’t let females adjust their calories below 1,200-1,320 calories per day, and 1,400-1,540 for males to keep your body functioning at its best.   


NEXT
When to adjust your calorie target    
 If you're expending more energy through exercise, then it's recommended that you eat to fuel this activity. Log your activity in Noom or sync the app to a wearable device, and this will increase your calorie goal—Noom will automatically add more calories to your range based on activity (half of what you burned with exercise).            Note that adding activity to Noom is not a way to “earn” food, rather it's important to replenish your energy.    
Your activity level is increased:
 You're not allowed to join Noom if you're pregnant. If you're lactating, talk to your doctor before embarking on any type of weight loss plan.            In general, it's recommended to eat at least 500-1,000 more calories per day while lactating. Please note that calorie needs vary based on lactation intensity, so consult with a doctor to find the right calorie goal for you.   
You’re lactating:
 If you’re regularly feeling hungry after reaching your calorie goal for the day, we recommend starting by adding about 100-200 calories (or a small snack) to your calorie goal and seeing how you feel.   
You’re hungry:


NEXT
    It’s important to note that       less is not best when it comes to your calorie target—you should aim to be eating in your calorie range, not below it.           Your body needs calories as energy to function (even basic bodily functions like breathing and blood pumping require energy!), and going below your calorie target can lead to headache, fatigue, a weakened immune system, and slow your metabolism down, among other negative side effects.        As you learn more about your body, your hunger cues, and more, you'll become even more in touch with how much your body needs to reach your goals and feel satisfied.           


DONE
To recap, your daily calorie range is:    <ul><li>Based on research and clinical recommendations for healthy weight loss    </li><li>Personalized for each person   </li><li>A recommendation that you should aim to meet (at minimum!)   </li><li>Able to be manually adjusted    </li></ul> Now you know a little more about how and why we ask you to track your calories. This will set you up for success on the Noom program—we’re rooting for you!

Make your calorie budget last

Next
 You’ve already learned lots of tricks to feel full while staying within your calorie budget—such as making healthy food swaps and eating less dense.           But we’ve got another trick up our sleeve. (Yes, we have sleeves, you couldn’t tell?)   


HELP ME PLAN
 It’s simple: planning.    The easiest way to stay within your calorie budget without going hungry is to plan ahead.          Here at Noom, we’ve noticed that people who strategize are far more likely to stay within their calorie budget.       Shall we design you a plan, too?                  
Step 1: Think about your preferences    What type of eater are you? (To know thyself is to know thy plan.)   
NEXT
A. I enjoy eating large meals.
B. I consider myself more of a snacker.

Step 2: Think about your day    What type of day are you going to have? (Note: You might plan differently on a weekday versus a weekend.)          
NEXT
A. I’m on the go all day long.
B. I’ve got some time to relax and enjoy my meals.

Step 2: Think about your day.   What type of day are you going to have? (Note: you might plan differently on a weekday versus a weekend.)
NEXT
A. I’m on the go all day long.
B. I’ve got some time to relax and enjoy my meals.

Priorities, priorities

NEXT
 Months ago, before signing up for Noom, you may have envisioned working out regularly or cooking healthy meals a few times a week. But sometimes life gets in the way, and those goals seem either more difficult or just not possible (for now, of course).           That’s okay! And expected. Sometimes, certain goals just seem like too much to take on, at least at the time.   


NEXT
 Even though you’re here now, we know your life remains challenging.           Whatever is going on with you today, we want to work with it, not against it.            So let’s talk a bit about prioritizing goals. Not in a vacuum, but in your own messy, unique reality.          


NEXT
 Goals during periods of stress and uncertainty usually look a bit different from your long-term goals, but they will ultimately contribute to YBP in some way.        For example, you might choose to work on trying the breathing exercises you learned earlier for 1 minute a day.        While it might not seem like it directly helps weight loss, it’s actually a great choice: It’s small and realistic, and by reducing your stress, it makes you less likely to reach for food to cope.

 It can be difficult to decide which habit, challenge, or situation you want to tackle first.       Luckily, there’s a trick for narrowing it down. We call it the       321 ILL method      .


FOR EXAMPLE?
Prioritize with 321 ILLFind    three Important things:    First, identify three parts of your life that feel    important    for you to address.   <ul><li>Ask yourself, "What’s hard right now? What’s making it difficult to stick to my calorie budget? If I had three wishes to change things in my control, what would they be?"</li></ul>Narrow down to    two Long-term challenges:    Narrow those three challenges down to two by choosing those that are most crucial to your    long-term goals.      <ul><li>Ask yourself, "How do these challenges get in the way of YBP right now? How will working on this challenge help today and a month down the line?"</li></ul>Settle on    one Low-stress challenge:    Of the two challenges you’ve narrowed down, identify the one that adds the    least stress    to your life. (Goals should be challenging, not stressful.) That’s your MVP.   


DONE
 Muhammad has been adjusting to a new remote job. It hasn’t been easy.        He identifies    three challenges that feel Important    to address right now:   <ul><li>Fog eating all day long instead of fuel eating meals and snacks.</li><li>Not reaching his step goal (like, not even close).</li><li>Missing the camaraderie of a traditional office.</li></ul> Of these challenges, he picks    two that will contribute to his Long-term success   :   <ul><li>Grazing all day long instead of eating meals and snacks.</li><li>Not reaching his step goal.</li></ul> Between the two challenges, tackling his fog eating seems less stressful. Right now, the idea of reaching his step goal feels overwhelming. Cutting back on fog eating is his    one Lower-stress goal.          All that’s left is for him to create a SMART goal to eat more mindfully, and he’s good to go. Just like you will be.

Move for more calories

I'M READY
 You already learned that planning ahead is a great way to stretch your calorie budget.            Ready for another trick?   


DONE
 Did you know you can increase your calorie budget every single day?                  It’s not magic! It’s exercise. (Please let us know if you have found a magical way to burn calories.)                 For every calorie you burn exercising, we’ll give you half a calorie back. That means if you burn 300 calories on a 30-minute bike ride, we’ll add 150 calories into your calorie budget.                 You’re probably thinking,    Why only half the calories?    It’s so you’ll maintain a caloric deficit—fewer calories coming in than going out.                  It’s math. And science. Er, math-science.       To log your activity, tap “   Track more progress   ” and choose “   Exercise.   ” There, you’ll find tons of options of activities to log.

Become a portion pro

LET'S
 You’ve already begun logging your food. Now we think it’s time you became a portion-size expert.          Let’s get started right away.          
 Can you guess how many ounces are in a steak?   
NEXT
A. 10 ounces.
B. 4 ounces.
C. Absolutely no clue.



NEXT
 Yep. It’s pretty difficult to estimate the weight of any steak (especially one you can’t see in real life). That’s because    estimating portion sizes and calories is remarkably tricky.          And without food scales, measuring cups, serving spoons, or objects for reference, it’s nearly impossible.          


SHOW ME
 So, if you’re suffering from portion distortion, know you’re not alone.    Studies show that most people have no idea how much they’re eating.          For example, the U.S. Department of Agriculture found that    six out of seven women underestimate their daily caloric intake by an average of 621 calories, and over 50% of men underestimate by 581 calories.          This level of underestimating could easily lead to weight gain. Remember, eating an extra 3,500 calories causes most of us to gain about a pound.       We’re not telling you this to scare you, but to empower you.    With the right tools, you    can    learn to eyeball portion sizes.    (Although the size of that steak may continue to elude you.)       Ready to access our portion size guide?           


TELL ME MORE
 Here’s how to find it: Log a food and tap 'More.' There, you’ll see our    portion size guide      .           In the guide, you’ll find all sorts of reference points for estimating portion sizes: a deck of cards, a dollar bill, or even your hand.           


GOT IT
 With that in mind, here are some good rules to follow:   Fruits and vegetables (Noom green foods)<ul><li>Pick large bowls, small bowls, fistfuls, or whole items of these foods.</li></ul>Starchy vegetables and whole grains<ul><li>Serve up a fistful, partial cup (1/2 cup or 1/4 cup), serving spoon, or ladle.</li></ul>Lean proteins<ul><li>Enjoy a dollar bill, deck of cards, or palmful.</li></ul>Healthy fats, sauces, spreads, and oils<ul><li>Opt for tablespoons, teaspoons, thumbs, and thumb tips.</li></ul>Dairy<ul><li>Choose a fistful, partial cup (1/2 cup or 1/4 cup), serving spoon, or ladle.</li></ul>

Shop smarter with Psych Tricks

HOW?
 Sometimes,    simply          knowing                that a fun food is in the next room is enough to tempt us into eating it.    (Hello, environmental trigger.)           But you can break that habit.   So far, you've learned to break habits by:<ul><li>Reframing your thought distortions.</li><li>Replacing a negative trigger with a positive trigger.</li></ul> We know what you’re thinking:    How do I change an environmental trigger when the trigger is literally my home?                      You’re about to find out.              


TEACH ME
Change your environment—and eliminate the trigger     If you find that you can't resist certain foods, you may need to keep them out of your home (for now, at least).       But ice cream mochi doesn’t just appear in your freezer. Kettle corn doesn’t just show up in your pantry.       These foods come from none other than    the grocery store: a large environmental trigger full of smaller environmental triggers      .           We know that making healthy choices at the grocery store is easier said than done. After all, that bake-at-home spanakopita seems to chase you down the freezer aisle.       That’s why we’ve put together five Psych Tricks to help you shop smarter.          


GOOD POINT
Trick #1: Go in the morning    Ever heard of    decision fatigue   ? That’s when    the quality of our decision-making deteriorates with every choice we make.    (That’s how bridesmaids end up in taffeta dresses, and how you end up with every candy bar displayed at the cash register.)       If you go to the grocery store after a long day, you’re going to be exhausted. By the end of the day, you’ve already made close to 35,000 decisions. (Wow. We know.) No wonder you come home with seven types of frozen pizza…and no milk.      The solution:    Go to the grocery store in the morning      .    That way, when deciding between ginger snaps and snickerdoodles, your fatigued mind won’t just decide to buy them both.


NEXT
Trick #2: Plan ahead    You already know that planning ahead is the best way to stick to your calorie goal.          Once you’ve planned your menu for the next few days, figure out what food you’ll need.    Then create a grocery list with whatever you’re missing.          When writing your list, group foods by sections in the grocery store   : fresh produce, canned goods, and our favorite—the cheese counter.        Doing this will help you:   <ul><li>Save time.</li><li>Stick to your list.</li><li>Reduce the number of decisions to make (and avoid decision fatigue).</li><li>Keep on track to YBP.</li></ul> Nobody’s perfect, but do your best to stick to your list.    Resisting the temptation to buy your favorite treat in the store is much easier than trying not to eat it when you’re at home.             


A-HA
Trick #3: Bring a buddy    There’s strength (and willpower) in numbers.    Going with a partner, coworker, family member, or friend who supports your journey can help you stick to your plan.          Oh, and bonus points! You’ve just turned a negative trigger into a positive one. (We’re so proud.)          


NEXT
Trick #4: Avoid the crowds    Grocery stores are overwhelming enough. Going during Sunday-night rush hour? Too much.      In fact,    shopping in a crowded store can influence your decisions and make you more susceptible to marketing messages.     (Yeah, we’re going to call nonsense on that toaster pastry claiming it’s brain fuel.)


NEXT
Tip #5: Exposure    You might remember exposure from when we talked about weighing yourself.    It’s a method that can help you overcome triggers.             Repeatedly exposing yourself to a trigger (like the junk food aisle) is like lifting weights.          It will be hard at first, but soon it’ll get easier and you’ll replace an unhelpful habit (saying “yes”) with a better habit (saying “no”).       But if you limit your exposure to the trigger, you’ll build a habit of avoiding it. And just ask a psychologist: Avoidance isn’t all it’s cracked up to be.        So, when in doubt, think of yourself as an emerging celebrity, and do it for the exposure.          


I COMMIT
Small steps lead to big changes.             
Which Psych Trick will you use the next time you hit up the grocery store?
Please select a trick
A. Shop in the morning.
B. Plan ahead.
C. Bring a buddy.
D. Avoid the crowds.
E. Expose yourself to a trigger at the grocery store.

    Congratulations, you’ve made it to Noom Apprentice!                    Now, we’re not ones to sugarcoat the truth. So here’s what you need to know: Getting started is hard. Sticking with it is even harder.                 Why? Because    m      otivation isn’t constant      .    Much like avocado ripeness—and everything else in life—motivation is always changing. It ebbs and flows.                  To ensure success, you’ll need to develop tools to handle these fluctuations.    In this mini-course, we’ll explore and help you build the skills you’ll need to stay motivated today, tomorrow, 10 years down the line…    and even on Taco Tuesday.   Welcome to Noom 201: Take charge of your motivation        Noom 201 takes an average of six to nine days to complete, but feel free to move at your own pace. During this motivation mini-course, you’ll come to:   <ul><li>Understand the motivation model.</li><li>Pinpoint where you are on the motivation model at any time.</li><li>Develop helpful tools you can use when your motivation ebbs or flows…or demands lasagna.</li><li>Increase your self-awareness by meeting your inner elephant and rider.</li><li>Learn how to use positive reinforcement, rewards, and behavioral tricks (to play on yourself, of course).</li><li>Expand the way you measure progress and define success.</li></ul> Ready to learn more about motivation?

Identify your motivation phase

MAKES SENSE
     Some days, you spring out of bed raring to start your morning workout. Other days, rolling off the couch to grab a bowl of popcorn feels borderline impossible.           If you feel like a different person from one day to the next, you’re not alone. Why?    Motivation is not constant—not for anyone.    Not even motivational speakers.       


TELL ME MORE
 Let’s get to know Noom’s    motivation model   : the usual path your motivation takes when you’re chasing a (very worthwhile) goal.    Phase 1: The hype    You’ve set out to achieve your goal, and everything feels shiny and new.    Your motivation is through the roof. Based on the answers you shared when you signed up, we can confirm that you were most definitely hyped. "This time will be different! Nothing will stop me!"    Peak 1: The honeymoon    Motivation keeps rising until it reaches an all-time high.    You feel like you could do this forever. "I'm on top of the world! I should get a second fridge just for storing kale!"       This honeymoon period could last days or weeks…or just a few hours, if you’re really unlucky. Then comes the plummet.          


WHAT NEXT?
Phase 2: The plummet The honeymoon’s over, and reality sets in.    You realize this is actually really, really hard.    "Hey, wait a second! You mean I’m actually supposed to use my gym membership? Continually?"          Your motivation, quite naturally, decreases.    (Blah.)   Trough 1: The lapse    The lapse is your plummet’s rock bottom.    Here, many people get stuck, and those dreaded thought distortions (remember them?) creep in. "I’ll never lose any weight. I’m so out of control. I’m a failure."        We promise, there’s no need to be hard on yourself.    This uncomfortable, no-fun-at-all lapse is completely normal   —and another good opportunity to learn and grow. (And wear sweatpants.)          


OKAY
Phase 3: The slips and surges After you get through your first lapse—and you will!—you’ll continue to experience    motivational highs and lows   . We call these slips and surges.        During a slip, you might phone in your workouts, or skip them altogether. (Or refuse all foods that don’t have melted cheese on them. Been there.) During a surge, you might shop at a nearby farmers market on your lunch break, sampling snap peas and strawberries while sneaking in an extra 1,000 steps.       So remember:    Don’t get too discouraged when you slip. Your next surge is right around the corner!             
 Pop quiz! Let’s test what you’ve learned. After the honeymoon comes…

A. The surge.
B. The slip.
C. The hype.
D. The plummet.
E. The thank-you notes.
 It’s:    D. The plummet.    Once that honeymoon is over, the plummet begins. Remember, when you feel your motivation slipping away, you haven’t done anything wrong. It’s normal, it’s natural, and you will get through it. Promise!

    Now that you know all about the motivation model, it’s time to start building your motivational tool kit.    You can use these skills to accomplish just about anything, from organizing your junk drawer to writing that novel to turning Your Big Picture into a reality.

Recommit to Your Big Picture

YES, WE DID
 When you joined Noom, you had some pretty worthwhile goals in mind. Together, we designed       Your Big Picture (YBP).                             Here’s a little refresher on YBP:    <embed alt="day8-task3-5.png" embedtype="image" format="left" id="4075"/>   


NEXT
 On day one, you defined your       Super Goal   —the goal you wanted to achieve by the end of the course.          Then we pushed you to dig deeper. We kept asking “why, why, why” you wanted to achieve this goal. Finally, we arrived at your deep, meaningful       Ultimate Why      —that driving focus that excites you and inspires you to work toward your Super Goal every day.       Next up, we’ll dive into the final portion of the YBP equation: what life’s going to be like once you achieve your Super Goal.          


AMAZING INDEED
Now, let’s imagine what life will look like on the other side of your goal.  We know what you’re thinking, "I joined Noom to build a more balanced breakfast burrito. Why are they acting like I have a crystal ball?"       Don’t worry! You can see into the future by practicing       creative visualization      —it’s a Psych Trick, not sorcery.    Creative visualization is an amazing tool that will help you:<ul><li>Overcome limitations and challenges. </li><li>Boost your self-efficacy (the belief in your own ability to succeed).</li><li>Reach your unique goals, whatever they may be.</li></ul>


I CAN SEE IT
To use creative visualization to picture how your life can change, follow these steps:<ol><li>   Close your eyes.    (No, really, close them! But you can wait until you’ve read all three steps.)</li><li>   Take a deep breath, and picture yourself having achieved your Super Goal.    Maybe you’re 10 pounds lighter. Maybe you’re feeling great about yourself at the beach. Maybe you’re hiking through the Grand Canyon on that dream backpacking trip. </li><li>   Now imagine yourself interacting with the new world around you.    Perhaps you’re more confident and outgoing in social situations. You stand up a little straighter, and even the way you walk has changed. Your life is different.</li></ol>

 One reason we introduced YBP right away is that it’s so, so essential to your success.    YBP will always serve as a great source of motivation as you work toward your goal.           In the spirit of staying motivated, we challenge you to recommit to your Super Goal and Ultimate Why. Let’s revisit them one more time.   
My Super Goal is…
Please enter your Super Goal (e.g., Run a 5K)
(Super Goal)
My Ultimate Why is…
Please enter your Ultimate Why (e.g., “I’m tired of watching my life pass me by”)
(Ultimate Why)


I BELIEVE
 Great job!            You said your Super Goal is…   
 And your Ultimate Why is…      
        Now all that’s left to do is reaffirm to us—well, most importantly, to yourself—that you really, truly believe. So… do you?      
I BELIEVE

 2. True or false? Motivation is constant.      
NEXT
A. True
B. False
 It’s:    B. False      .    Motivation ebbs and flows. As you work toward your goal, you’ll experience times of high motivation (surges) and low motivation (slips). Both are totally normal.

Quick Motivational Tip #1

YES
 While motivation isn’t constant, there are tools you can use to refuel your motivation—fast. One tool: using       Quick Motivational Tips      . These tiny tips are small things you can do anytime your motivation needs a boost. (And trust us, you’re going to want a pick-me-up at some point soon.)           Ready to learn your first Quick Motivational Tip?   


GOT IT
Quick Motivational Tip #1: Let it go    Even if you do literally everything right, your days won’t always go as planned. Despite your best meal prepping, playlist planning, and intention setting, things are going to go awry. You will go over your calorie goal. You will miss a workout. You will give in to your trigger. (Hello cheese plate, my old friend.)          When things don't go perfectly, take a deep breath and       let it go      .           What matters most is keeping your eye on the prize: Your Big Picture.          
GOT IT
Wipe your slate clean

GOT IT
 Ever mindlessly eaten a stale donut, then felt like your whole day was ruined? Or fought with a friend, only to feel like garbage for the rest of the week? Woken up in a cold sweat in the middle of the night, remembering that time you called your boss "mom?”       Whether you’ve had a bad morning, a bad day, week, or year…    this very instant is an opportunity to start over.                 <embed alt="day9-welcomeB.png" embedtype="image" format="left" id="4107"/>           If you ever feel stuck in a rut, just remember that right now (and now… and now) is your opportunity to start again.

Reinforcement and rewards

TELL ME
 You already know that motivation is important—that it ebbs and flows. Some days, you’ll prepare fancy salads. Other days, you’ll only have eyes for empanadas—and your couch. (And competitive cooking shows.)           But what is motivation, really? How does it work? And how do you get more of it?   
 Let’s investigate with—you guessed it—a quiz.        Fill in the blank: Reinforcement __________ the chances you’ll act a certain way.          
NEXT
A. Boosts
B. Lowers
C. Doesn’t affect
 It’s:    A. Boosts      .    Reinforcement makes you more likely to behave one way or another. Think high fives and fist-bumps.   
 Fill in the blank: Punishment __________ the chances you’ll behave in a particular way.   
NEXT
A. Ups
B. Lessens
C. Doesn’t impact
 It’s:    B. Lessens      .    Punishment lessens the chances you’ll behave in a particular way. (After a sizable late fee at the library, you stop forgetting to return those graphic novels on time.)   


NEXT
    Reinforcement   —like a gold star—strengthens behavior and makes you more likely to do something again. (Remember chore charts?).    Punishment   —yes, like being grounded—discourages behavior and leaves you less likely to repeat your actions.        Here are two examples:                 Reinforcement:       After a stressful day, you dig into a pint of ice cream. You get a hit of chocolate chip cookie dough—and a rush of satisfaction. So the next time you’re stressed, you go straight for that rush—from the ice cream, of course.              Punishment:        You skip a planned workout after a long day, and you feel guilty and a little ashamed. So the next time you’re exhausted, you drag yourself to leg day, anyway—because you want to avoid that awful feeling again.          


GOT IT
 Reinforcement can be either positive or negative. Both types of reinforcement make you more likely to do something again.                       Positive reinforcement    encourages your behavior by adding something—like a compliment or a high five.    <ul><li>Your social media followers always like the pictures you post of healthy, new recipes. So you try, and share, even more new recipes. </li></ul>                 Negative reinforcement    encourages behavior, too, but by removing something—like a friend’s nag or customer’s dirty look.    <ul><li>After cooking a new recipe, you leave the dirty dishes in the sink for too long—and you're getting the stink eye from your roommate. So next time, you make sure to clean up after yourself sooner.</li></ul>


NEXT
 The same goes for punishment—there’s positive punishment and negative punishment. They make you less likely to repeat a behavior.                 Positive punishment    discourages your behavior by adding something—like a parking ticket.   <ul><li>When you forget to feed the meter, your town rewards you with a parking ticket. (Lucky you!) When you run errands the following week, you set a timer on your phone so you don’t make the same mistake again.</li></ul>                 Negative punishment    also discourages behavior, but by removing something—like, say, your car.   <ul><li>You forget to pay off the parking ticket, so the city takes away your car. (Ouch. What kind of fictional city tows your car after just one delinquent ticket?) </li></ul>
 A reward is an example of:      
NEXT
A. Positive reinforcement.
B. Negative reinforcement.
C. Positive punishment.
D. Negative punishment.
 It’s:    A. Positive reinforcement.    Remember, positive reinforcement strengthens your behavior by giving you something—like a compliment or a cool bumper sticker or an all-expenses-paid trip to Aruba.       


I SEE
 Pop quiz: What’s gray and mushy and motivated by rewards?                 Your brain!           Rewards fall into the “Consequence” bucket of the behavior chain.              <embed alt="day9-task2-7B.png" embedtype="image" format="left" id="4101"/>                         And you know why that’s important? Because it’s how a habit is formed.          


DONE
 When you receive a reward, your brain releases    dopamine   —a chemical that causes a feel-good    rush of pleasure      .           Your brain likes this feeling (of course), and associates the pleasure with whatever you did to receive it—like digging into ice cream or posting your meals on social media.           So to get more of that feeling, you repeat the behavior chain... over and over again.          Which is why rewards help you form habits.

Add—don’t subtract—food

LET’S GO
 Losing weight doesn’t mean going hungry. You’ve learned about filling up on green and yellow foods, sticking to an eating schedule, and planning your meals ahead of time.                     Important information, for sure, but you’re here for more than that. You’re here for Psych Tricks.            And that’s exactly what we’re going to deliver. Right this second.    


NEXT
 Have you ever started a diet and thought to yourself, "Wow, I basically can’t eat anything but salad. This diet is going to be such a blast."       Many diets focus on restricting calories, labeling certain foods as off-limits, making portions smaller, and eating fewer meals.        But when we focus on depriving ourselves like that, it’s not only boring—it’s counterproductive. We end up getting hungry (or grumpy) and eventually overeat. ("This baguette’s 'off-limits?' Better polish off the whole thing now so I’m only out-of-bounds once today   .   ")        Not exactly the most motivating feeling in the world.          


NEXT
 To avoid feeling deprived,    try to shift from a removal mindset ("I can’t, I don’t have") to an addition mindset ("I can, I do have").           Instead of: "Look at all the ice cream I can’t eat."           Think: "Look at all the fruit I can try. (And all the blueberries are on sale!)"       Adding foods—yes, even produce—to your diet is a form of positive reinforcement, which is great for motivation. (Just think of it as rewarding yourself for this Noom endeavor.)           


NEXT
    Now, let’s get you in that addition mindset with six new Psych Tricks.       1. Add a new food to your grocery list each week        Ever heard of fiddleheads? Salsify? Kohlrabi? Romaine? Okay, you know the last one, but the rest are all nutritious, delicious, and unique vegetables that don’t make it onto most shopping lists.          


NEXT
2. Reintroduce an old favorite to your menu—in a new way        Love lasagna? Who doesn’t. But finding room in your calorie budget for a slice or three can be tricky. Try to make a lightened-up version with some healthy swaps: roasted eggplant slices for noodles, and low-fat mozzarella instead of full-fat cheese.           


NEXT
3. Mix up your meal plan        Have you finally found enough healthy meals to map out your menu for the week? Add a different meal in ASAP—before you get bored. Add a new smoothie to your breakfast options, or snack on almonds instead of the usual pistachios. (Or start a healthy snack stash—that totally counts as adding.)          


NEXT
4. Visit a new restaurant         Expand your horizons by trying out a new, healthy restaurant in your neighborhood.       Who knows, they might even introduce you to your future favorite dish—like coconut crusted seitan with charred mango salsa. (Yum.)          


NEXT
5. Attempt a completely new recipe        Scour your favorite celebrity chef’s social media feed for healthy inspiration, or check our 'Recipes' link on the home screen. Just get in the kitchen and have some fun. Make a mess!          


NEXT
6. Add a treat        If you're satisfied with a square or two of dark chocolate, treat yourself daily. If you're more of a frosted fudge brownie type, make it a weekly event.

 It’s time for another Quick Motivational Tip.            So relax, sit back, and grab a bag of green food. (Grapes, perhaps? A watermelon?)   


WHY NOT?
Quick Motivational Tip #2: Take a break              That’s right. We want you to take it easy. Just a momentary mini-vacation.                 We know what you’re thinking. "Shouldn’t I be earning back my half calories through exercise? Or trying to sneak in more steps? (Or shopping for new sneakers for said steps?)"           Yes—but not always.   


DONE
    When we go, go, go all the time, we eventually burn out.    It’s not sustainable. And you’re trying to change your life, not pack for a last-minute trip.        Many people think that taking a break will delay them from achieving their goals.    But taking a break can actually help you regroup, refocus, and feel more “on track” than you did before.           Now go take a break, okay? And if you can't do it right this second, set aside 5 minutes tonight to just relax. Even if it’s not your thing, just give it a shot—it’ll help.

All about the downward spiral

RIGHT
 Have you ever had one small, anxious thought (   Was Jerome offended that I didn’t go to his ’80s-themed party?   ), then had that tiny idea transform into an all-out catastrophe? Suddenly, you’re thinking,    Everyone hates me and I’ll never have friends ever again.          If you’ve ever had this happen—and we bet you have—you already know all about the downward spiral. After all, feeling this way is really human.       (Also, saying no to themed parties is a form of self-care sometimes. So good for you.)   


NEXT
    The downward spiral is when one negative thought leads to another negative thought, then another, and another, and another…until your thoughts have spiraled out of control   .        And it happens to everyone. (Even psychologists.)   


NEXT
 But why does this spiral happen?       The answer is twofold:   <ol><li>   Our brains have a negativity bias.   </li><li>   Downward spirals feel kind of good, in a twisted way. At least, we think so.   </li></ol> Let’s flesh this out a bit.   


NEXT
1. Our brains have a negativity bias      We’ll talk about this a lot more later, but for now, know this:    Negative things (like a crying baby) cause greater excitement (stimulation) than positive or neutral things (like a nice car or, um, a hair dryer, for example).           And once we feel a certain way (sad, angry, lonely), we’re more likely to notice other things that cause us to feel similar emotions. Like a breakup song playing in a grocery store when we’re already feeling unlucky in love.   


NEXT
2. Downward spirals feel good    Sounds weird, but just stick with us.        We know from the behavior chain that consequences are what make or break a habit. And when the consequences of an action are more favorable (at least short-term), you’re more likely to repeat that action…and turn it into a habit.   


I SEE
 We know what you’re thinking:    How could anything good possibly come from a downward spiral?          Consider it this way.        Oftentimes,    downward spirals can give you a false sense of control, which can help you feel less stress and more relief—at least in the moment      .    (That’s your favorable consequence right there.)        Plus, you’re less likely to feel disappointed when you’re already imagining the worst. That’s just you protecting yourself.       But even though downward spirals might make you feel good for a minute or two, trust us: They’re a trap, and they end up causing more stress than they alleviate. The more you can avoid them, the better.   


DONE
 And that’s where grounding comes in. Ground yourself, and you can prevent those thoughts from spiraling out of control.       So, let’s keep on keeping your mind grounded.

<embed alt="day10-welcomeA.png" embedtype="image" format="left" id="4129"/>        Ever feel like you’re all or nothing? Eating really mindfully or just scarfing down everything in sight? Hitting the gym all the time or just glued to the couch?           Meet Sarah. She was feeling the exact same way. Until...   


NEXT
 She learned about moderation—which, let’s face it, is harder than it sounds.       Especially when, like Sarah, you’re used to dieting and going into extremes.       Once, she cut out all carbs—that didn’t last. Next, she consumed only green juice—that didn’t last, either. (But hey, at least she has all the cool juice bottles in her cupboard now.)   


NEXT
 Here’s what changed.       When working with Coach Tiffany, Sarah identified her all-or-nothing thought distortions. Then she reframed them to turn those thoughts into something helpful.       “I can never eat cookies again” became “I can fit cookies into my calorie budget three days a week.”       “I need to work out seven days a week” changed to “I will reach my step goal every day and move four times a week in a way I enjoy—like yoga, long walks, or weight lifting.”       “I gained 2 pounds this week, so this course isn’t working” became “This is just a small slip in my lifelong journey.”       “I ate too many chips, so my day is ruined” changed to “My next meal is another chance to make a healthier choice.”   


DONE
 Today, Sarah’s feeling great. She’s down 13 pounds—and counting. She’s learned that slips and surges are part of the deal. And that while the occasional juice can be fun, food is meant to be chewed.

Three ways to boost satiety

LET’S GO
 Once you get the hang of    your calorie budget, it can be a really powerful weight-loss tool      .                     One reason: It can make decision-making easier. Instead of wondering about that slice of carrot cake, you can do a little math. ("50 calories left in my budget... carrot cake is 350 calories… I’ll just take a few licks of that cream cheese frosting and call it a day.")           But carrot cake aside, how do you get the most out of your calorie budget? With satiety tricks, like the three we’ve rounded up just for you. (And all the other Noomers taking this lesson.)

B. 5 slices of dried apple (100 calories).
C. Doesn't matter—100 calories is 100 calories.
 It’s:    A. 1 large apple (100 calories)      .    A higher-volume, lower-CD option like an apple is a great choice. Especially if you’re a teacher’s pet.      


NEXT
Trick #1: Eat low-caloric-density foods      Okay, you already know this—but hey, we’re here to help you consolidate.        Foods with low CD give you a lot of bang for your calorie buck. As a rule of thumb, green foods like fruits, vegetables, and broth-based soups are great choices to make your calorie budget work for you.          
 Surprise quiz! (Again.)       Which of these will keep you feeling more full?   
NEXT
A. 1/2 cup cooked white rice (100 calories).
B. 1/2 cup cooked brown rice (100 calories).
C. Doesn’t matter—100 calories is 100 calories. (And all sushi is good sushi.)
 It’s:    B. 1/2 cup cooked brown rice (100 calories)      .    Why? Brown rice has fiber. And fiber is filling.    


NEXT
Trick #2: Fill up on fiber    Fiber has lots of fans—namely, GI doctors—because it’s so helpful with digestion.        But here at Noom, we love fiber because it’s filling. Why?       First,    high-fiber foods take longer for your body to digest.           Second,    your body treats high-fiber foods differently than other foods.    With high-fiber foods, some of the fiber goes right through your digestive system, unchecked. This means that when you eat a (very fibrous) broccoli slaw, you won’t experience the same blood sugar spike you do when you chow down on that (very frosting-y) red velvet cake.        And trust us, you want stable blood sugar. When your blood sugar spikes and drops suddenly, especially right after eating, you’re not going to be happy. And you’re going to be very hungry. Dare we say, ravenous.          Here are some examples of healthy, high-fiber options:          
    <ul><li>Spinach</li><li>Kale</li><li>Artichokes</li><li>Brussels sprouts</li><li>Cauliflower</li><li>Zucchini</li><li>Broccoli</li></ul>    
Vegetables
    <ul><li>Sweet potato</li><li>Squash</li><li>Corn</li><li>Parsnips</li><li>Plantains</li><li>Peas</li><li>Beans</li><li>Lentils</li></ul>

    <ul><li>Quinoa</li><li>Brown rice</li><li>Oatmeal</li><li>Millet</li><li>Rye</li><li>Spelt</li><li>Buckwheat</li></ul>

 And another quiz. (You’re not surprised anymore, are you?)       The food that will keep me full the longest is…   
NEXT
A. 3 ounces of chicken (120 calories).
B. 1 small baked potato (120 calories).
C. 1 tablespoon of olive oil (120 calories).
D. Doesn’t matter—120 calories is 120 calories.
E. Why does Noom keep asking me this?
 It’s:    A. 3 ounces of chicken (120 calories).    Why? Macronutrients.   


NEXT
Trick #3: Choose nutrients wisely    Macronutrients—proteins, carbohydrates, and fats—provide you with energy in the form of calories. But they don’t make us feel full and satisfied equally.       When it comes to satiety, it’s protein that takes the cake. Or the (protein-rich) crab cake, we suppose.       Now, that doesn’t mean you need to eat egg whites all day, every day, until the end of time—although we do love a good meringue. It just means you should try to    include some protein at every meal.          Here are some ideas:          
    <ul><li>Fish and seafood like salmon, trout, cod, oysters, and shrimp.</li><li>Poultry like turkey, chicken, and duck.</li><li>Meat like beef, lamb, goat, pork, and veal.</li><li>Eggs and egg whites.</li></ul>    
Animal protein
    <ul><li>Tofu</li><li>Tempeh</li><li>Beans like black beans, kidney beans, and soybeans</li><li>Peas like chickpeas and split peas</li><li>Lentils</li></ul>    
Plant-based protein
    <ul><li>Dairy products like milk, yogurt (especially Greek-style), and cheese.</li><li>Nuts and nut butters like peanut, almond, and cashew.</li><li>Seeds like chia, flax, hemp, and sunflower.</li><li>Grains like quinoa, oats, millet, and rye.</li><li>Supplements like protein powders.</li></ul>    
Other sources of protein

 Here’s how to incorporate high-protein foods into a balanced meal:   
    <ul><li>Omelet: 1 egg and 2 egg whites, spinach, and mushrooms + 1 small banana.</li><li>Parfait: 3/4 cup Greek yogurt + 1 cup berries + 10 almonds.</li><li>Oatmeal: 1/2 cup oatmeal + 1 tablespoon peanut butter + 1/2 apple.</li><li>Eggs: 2 eggs + 2 slices turkey bacon + 1 slice whole-grain toast + 1/4 avocado.</li></ul>    
High-protein breakfasts
    <ul><li>Simple salad: 1 cup spinach + 1/2 cup tomatoes + 4 ounces chicken breast + 1/4 avocado + lemon juice</li><li>Sandwich: 2 slices whole-grain bread + 4 ounces tuna + 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard + 1/2 cup cucumber</li><li>Bean salad: 1 cup mixed beans + 1/2 cup diced peppers + olives + 1 ounce feta cheese + 1/4 avocado</li><li>Snack pack: 2 hard-boiled eggs + 1/2 cup carrot sticks + 1/2 cup bell peppers + 2 tablespoons hummus + 8 whole-grain crackers + 1 ounce cheese</li></ul>    
High-protein lunches
    <ul><li>Simple: 4 ounces cooked chicken + 1 cup sautéed kale + 1 small sweet potato</li><li>Pasta: 4 ounces lean ground turkey + 1 cup cooked spaghetti squash + 1/2 cup tomato sauce + 1 cup spinach</li><li>Stir-fry: 4 ounces tofu + 1 cup mixed vegetables + 1/2 tablespoon olive oil + 1/2 cup brown rice</li></ul>    
High-protein dinners
    <ul><li>1 small (5-ounce) can of tuna + 10 whole-grain crackers</li><li>1 hard-boiled egg + 10 almonds</li><li>4 slices turkey breast + 1/2 cup cucumber</li><li>1/2 cup edamame + 1 ounce low-fat cheese</li><li>2 ounces turkey jerky (but watch out for sodium)</li><li>1/2 cup roasted chickpeas (flavor them with paprika, cayenne, or turmeric for a new twist)</li><li>1/2 cup cottage cheese + 1/2 cup berries</li></ul>    
High-protein snacks

 Eating the same salad every day can get boring, fast. And walking the same few blocks can quickly get old.

Walk it out

GOT IT
In a time crunch? (15 minutes) Walk as fast as you can for 15 minutes—it should be hard to talk to a friend at this pace. If you want an extra challenge, add small hand weights.      On a treadmill? (25 minutes) Walk on an incline for 1 minute, then walk on a flat surface for 2 minutes. Repeat a total of eight times.       Outside? (however long you want) Grab your headphones and start walking to music at a moderate pace. Every time the chorus comes on, walk as fast as you can. (Like musical chairs, except no chairs. And no breaks.)          
Just keep swimming

GOT IT
In a time crunch? (15 minutes) Swim as fast as you can for 2 minutes. Rest for 1 minute. Complete a total of five times.      Feeling fancy? (20 minutes) Were you a swimmer back in high school? Try an individual medley with all four swim strokes. Swim one lap of freestyle, one lap of breaststroke, one lap of backstroke, then one lap of butterfly without stopping. Then rest for 30 to 60 seconds. Complete eight sets.      Have some time to spare? (30 minutes) Swim at a moderate pace for 15 minutes. Your only goal? Not stopping. Then jog through the water for 5 minutes. Then swim as fast as you can for 5 minutes. Cool down for 5 minutes at a slow, leisurely pace. (You’ll probably need it.)

GOT IT
Add variety with colorful foods                 As a rule of thumb, we aim to get 2-3 different colors at each meal, which means you'll also be eating 2-3 different foods (bonus points if you choose new or newer to you foods.    For example, chicken with a sweet potato (orange) and a salad with spinach (green) and tomato (red).     There's nothing magical about the number 3—we just find this a realistic goal to shoot for! Sustainability is always the name of the game.   Fact: When it comes to fruits and veggies, their colors usually reflect the nutrients in them.            For example, the antioxidant lycopene gives tomatoes, papaya, watermelon, red bell peppers, and grapefruit, their red/pink hues. On the other hand, purple and blue foods like blueberries, blackberries, grapes, and more contain anthocyanin, a different antioxidant.           So, by enjoying a rainbow of fruits and veggies, you're also enjoying a rainbow of nutrients.                 


GOT IT
Add variety with texture        Incorporating texture is a quick and easy way to add enjoyment and variety to keep your healthy eating journey from becoming boring and bland.           Bonus:    Research published in the journal    Appetite    found that increasing what scientists call "textural complexity" of a meal significantly decreases food intake.           The effect is two-fold.           Playing with texture increases "oral processing time" (that's the time food stays in your mouth) and "satiety," helping people eat less and feel more satisfied in the process.

Add variety with seasoning Real talk: Steamed brussels sprouts aren't as good as fried brussels sprouts. But toss them in balsamic vinegar, olive oil, and salt, roast for 45 minutes at 350 degrees, and they are unreal. Seriously. Try it.                      Here are 3 ways to savor the flavor!                               
 You’d be surprised how a pinch of paprika or a dash of dill can change the taste of your food entirely.   <ul><li>Spice up your meat, chicken, fish, or tofu with chili or cayenne for a kick.</li><li>Add fresh herbs to your salads for a burst of flavor.</li><li>Roast sweet potato, squash, turnips, and carrots with rosemary and olive oil for a savory side -- or cinnamon and nutmeg for a sweet snack.</li></ul>
Spice and season
 Small changes in the way you prepare your food can lead to big changes in flavor.   <ul><li>Grill proteins or vegetables to give them a smoky flavor</li><li>Roast vegetables in the oven for a crispy, comforting taste</li><li>Cook brown rice, quinoa, or other grains in low-sodium beef, chicken, or vegetable stock to add some flavor</li></ul>
Cook creatively
 We're not trying to get all philosophical on you (we're psychologists, not philosophers), but sometimes it’s not about what you’re eating, but how you’re eating it. Pairing sweet, salty, savory and bitter foods, or mixing crunchy, creamy, and crumbly textures, can make your meals more enjoyable.            Looking for inspiration?            Make a spinach salad with savory spiced chicken breast, sliced cucumber for crunch, diced avocado for a creamy texture, a handful of strawberries for a sweet spin, and top it with a spoonful of hummus for a little bit of salt.   
Pair perfectly

Noom 201: Keep up the good work

SOUNDS GOOD
    12 lessons down, 15 to go.                     And whether you’re trying to come back from a motivational slip and riding the wave of a surge, it's not time to quit.            Completing lessons acts as positive reinforcement for your habit of Nooming. There's a method to our madness, remember? And eventually, your habit will be so strong that it won't be subject to the ebbs and flows of your motivation. Noom will be your new normal. Doesn't that have a nice ring to it?   


DONE
 Not every endeavor will be smooth sailing, of course. But remember:              <embed alt="stickynote" embedtype="image" format="fullwidth" id="7444"/>              A wave you face is not an obstacle, but an opportunity: an opportunity to learn about yourself, an opportunity to prove your strength, an opportunity to develop new skills, an opportunity to come out wiser.           Here's your daily reminder. You might be facing waves, but you're making them, too. Whatever you're going through, ride the wave.            You’ve got this.

Train your inner elephant

HAD THAT DINNER BEFORE
 You get home after a long day. Suddenly, you hear a familiar little voice in the back of your mind:    You know what would make a good dinner? Half a bag of stale tortilla chips.                    That voice belongs to your inner elephant.   


NEXT
 Turns out your brain is actually home to two beings. In psychology, we call them the    elephant    and the    rider.               The rider is our rational, analytical side. It’s our self-control.            The rider chooses meal prep over mac and cheese, a hike over happy hour.           


NEXT
    The elephant is our impulsive, irrational, emotional side.          The elephant wants rainbow sherbet and guilty-pleasure TV. When your favorite running shirt’s in the hamper, the elephant says to just run tomorrow when it’s clean. (Then follows it up with, “Laundry? Meh, that can wait too.”)       Despite the rider’s best efforts, the elephant often wins out.   


NEXT
 But there’s plenty you can do to get your (very rational) rider and your (very wild) elephant to coexist.       The best way to help your rider is to plan.   
 Know when and where your elephant acts out, and have a plan to manage it. Does your elephant steer you toward the vending machine when you’re searching for an afternoon snack? Keep a stash of healthy snacks at work. Does your elephant always have a good reason or two to skip your evening workout? Head to the gym in the morning instead.   
1. Know your elephant and come prepared
 Controlling your environment makes your rider’s life easier. Keep triggers—like your kid’s cereal—out of sight. Then, put healthy cues like your water bottle, a fruit bowl, or an inspirational sticky note right where you can see them.       
2. Control your environment
 Remember decision fatigue? The more decisions we make, the more questionable (and often cheesier and greasier) our choices are. Think of it as the rider getting tired and the elephant taking advantage. By planning your meals and workouts ahead, your elephant will have less space to run amok.      
3. Make decisions before you’re exhausted
 Scheduling an event or putting together a plan may make you feel more accountable, especially when there is a consequence if you don’t follow through. This is called a    commitment device      .    Pay in advance for that weightlifting class at your gym, and suddenly, you’re that much more likely to show up. (Sorry, elephant. We’ll get charged a fee if we skip it.)        
4. Have a plan and commit to it
 Things don’t always go as planned, and that’s okay. But when things go off script, that’s when your elephant will try to break free. Don’t let it—come prepared with a plan B so you’re not making any wild (or regrettable) decisions.       
5. Have a backup plan


GOT IT
 You can also help your rider by keeping your elephant relaxed and happy. Here’s how to train it:    
 While it’s healthy to have goals, when there’s a big gap between where you are and where you want to be, your elephant feels overwhelmed and restless. Setting realistic goals is a great way to help your elephant and rider work together with confidence.      
1. Set realistic goals
 You’re making changes for the long haul. Swearing off fried chicken might work for a week or month, but at what cost? Seriously—at what cost? Plan regular treats—edible and otherwise— to keep your elephant happy and under control.       
2. Treat yourself regularly
 Don’t yell at or ignore your elephant. (Poor elephant.) Your emotional, impulsive side just needs to be acknowledged with a few wins from time to time. So accept it, befriend it, and toss it the occasional piece of Gouda.       
3. Be nice to your elephant
 If you slip, don’t overcorrect by doubling your gym time or cutting out orange foods. Instead, use that first Quick Motivational Tip, let it go—and then get back to your routine. When you’re too strict with your elephant, it starts to feel deprived—and that’s dangerous territory. Deprived elephants make emotional decisions—and massive plates of midnight nachos.       
4. Recover as usual—or let it go


I COMMIT
    Now that you know how to help your rider and train your elephant, let's practice.      
1. Imagine a situation that gives you trouble:
Please enter a situation (e.g., getting home late from work)
(enter a situation)
2. Identify how your elephant trips you up:
Please enter how your elephant trips you up (e.g., tells me to eat chocolate chips for dinner)
(enter how your elephant trips you up)
3. Choose two tools—one to help your rider and one to keep your elephant happy:
Please enter two tools (e.g., planning ahead and having chocolate once in a while)
(enter your two tools)
 Solid work. So, what do you say: Do you commit to helping your rider, and training your elephant?

A. Your rational, analytical side.
B. Your impulsive, irrational, emotional side.
C. I don’t even have room for an air fryer. Where would I put an elephant?
 It’s:    B. Your impulsive, irrational, emotional side.    Your inner elephant is the part of your brain that wants that second bag of chips and tells you the gym will be there tomorrow. But remember: To train your elephant, you have to show it some love—and throw it the occasional treat.

Quick Motivational Tip #3: Share your journey

KNOCK KNOCK
 We’ve got a little something for you.              Curious? Why not open up door number three and see what’s inside. (And no, sorry, it’s not that immersion blender you’ve been eyeing.)   


TELL ME MORE
Quick Motivational Tip #3: Share your journey        Surprise! It’s a Quick Motivational Tip. Here it is:                 Sharing your journey can help you stay motivated and achieve your goals. So stick your head out the window and shout your goal at the top of your lungs. Or tell your neighbor or text your aunt—whatever works for you.           It doesn’t really matter how you share, only that you do it. How do we know? You know the answer: psychology.    


LET’S DO THIS
 Sharing your journey is great for two reasons.                  First, it makes your commitment more official, motivating you to keep going, and increasing the likelihood that you'll achieve your goals.    Fast fact: People that have a support system in place through friends and family lose weight 32% faster than those who don’t!              Secondly, a supporter will provide you with the help you need when you hit a rough patch. And trust us... we all need that from time to time. You'll have a day when you make some less healthy food choices. Okay, maybe more than one day. You may hit a weight plateau, and feel frustrated that your weight hasn’t changed in days. When those things happen, who are you going to call? Hint: It’s not Ghostbusters!   

NOT NOW
NEXT
 So how can you go about finding an accountability partner... or two or three? Here are our top three recommendations:              <ol><li>   Nominate a supporter.    Tell a friend or family member what you’re most excited about on your Noom journey. Offer them pointers on your new favorite healthy foods. Invite them to go on a daily walk with you. The more they know how to support you, the better they’ll be at helping.      </li><li>   Share your progress!    Your supporter doesn’t have to be just one person. Consider continually sharing your progress through a social group. You can share your weight graph or other milestones along your journey through various messengers, emails, or texts. Or consider expanding your support group even wider by publicly posting on social media. Trust us, you’ll get a lot of congratulatory messages!      </li><li>   Go through the program with someone!    There’s no better way to find support than to go through the Noom journey together with someone you care about. Not only will it increase the likelihood of your success in the program, it can also help forge new bonds and build a foundation for long-term health and wellness for both of you. And here are some extra rewards for bringing someone along on the journey... you get a $20 Amazon gift card for referring a friend, and they will get 20% off their subscription. It’s a win for everyone.</li></ol>

 Another Quick Motivational Tip? What can we say, we were motivated to keep ’em coming.                Quick Motivational Tip #4: Picture success When it comes to tracking progress, a picture really is worth a thousand words. And the more vivid, the better.                  Consider snapping pictures of:   <ul><li>You wearing pants that no longer fit (in a good way).</li><li>A new mango–red onion salsa you made. </li><li>That cool starfruit you tried for the first time this week. </li><li>Your new grocery store finds—like pre-cut zucchini noodles and salmon burgers.</li><li>Sunset runs—or run-ins with sunsets. </li><li>Your hard-earned rest day (where you did not get out of your pajamas).</li><li>The first time you hit 10,000 steps.</li></ul> Capturing photos of your wins can help you stay motivated. Plus, when you’re feeling down, reviewing those images can help turn a slip into a surge—or at least help you tell your inner elephant to take it down a notch.                 For bonus points, share your pictures with friends and family. Or put them on social media, and show everyone from high school how far you’ve come. (And that you now know how to make soup dumplings.)           Ready for your photo shoot?

Build your frustration tolerance

TELL ME MORE
 Whenever you’re trying to make a change, obstacles (and new ice cream flavors) are going to pop up—and frustration is normal.                  Turns out that every human has a different    frustration tolerance      .    That’s what psychologists call    the ability to handle a situation that causes discomfort.               Learn to handle frustration, and you could score some long-term benefits.   


GREAT
 Here’s an example.       Since joining Noom, Andre has been trying to move his body more.        He loved dancing as a kid, so he signs up for a class. The first day is a disaster—Andre can’t remember the choreography and his feet are throbbing. By the end, even jazz hands seem like a stretch.       He wants to quit, but reminds himself that all this cardio will help him achieve his Super Goal of hiking the Grand Canyon.        Two months later, Andre’s always the first dancer to nail a new move—and he’s building the stamina he needs for his big trip to Arizona.   
 Pop quiz. Andre has:   
NEXT
A. High frustration tolerance.
B. Low frustration tolerance.
C. The wrong tap shoes.
 It’s:    A. High frustration tolerance.    Andre was uncomfortable at dance class, but he stuck with it anyway. (And he just needed to break in those shoes.)   


NEXT
 Maya likes dancing, too.        She joins the same dance studio as Andre, but after her first day, Maya’s frustration gets the best of her. All she can think about is how many times she tripped or stumbled…and how naturally the moves seemed to come to everyone else. (Obviously, they were undercover pros masquerading as beginners.)        Maya’s too frustrated to focus on her YBP. She stops showing up to class, and that’s that.   
 Pop quiz. Maya has:   
NEXT
A. High frustration tolerance.
B. Low frustration tolerance.
C. A forfeited deposit at an unlicensed dance academy.
 It’s:    B. Low frustration tolerance.    Maya felt so frustrated she decided to stop going to class almost right away.      


LET’S DO IT
 Maya didn’t do anything wrong, of course. But with the right tools, she might have stuck around the dance studio for at least a few more sessions.        Increasing your frustration tolerance is a skill you can learn by—you guessed it—changing the way you think.           When you’re frustrated, thought distortions run rampant.          I’ll never be able to stop storm eating. I’m too out of shape to run. This dance class is too advanced for me. My body will never get stronger.    (Sound familiar?)       But if you can learn to crush thought distortions—with a tool like reframes—you can learn to handle frustration better.        Or you could overcome them with a brand-new Psych Trick…           


OH, SWELL
 It’s called an “oh, well” statement.       “Oh, well” means you acknowledge how you feel in the moment (read: not great)…so you can accept it and carry on. (And keep going back to that dance class.)       We like to think of an “oh, well” statement as a motivation mantra to help you handle frustrating situations. You might say:       “Oh, well. This will get easier over time.”    “Oh, well. I'll come out stronger in the end.”    “Oh, well. I’m not going to give up now.”       And our personal favorite:       “Oh, well. I’ll still be one step closer to my goal.”   


DONE
 Now it’s time to craft your own “oh, well” statement.       How?   <ol><li>Imagine a frustrating situation in your weight-loss journey.</li><li>Identify your thought distortions.</li><li>Think about what you could say to help you accept the situation and push through.</li></ol>
My “oh, well” statement is…

Measure progress without a scale

OH NO
 You’re eating lots of green foods—literally. You’re sticking to your calorie budget. You’re exercising a few days a week. You’re hitting your step goal. You’re sleeping better. You’re even doing your box breath. (Nice work, by the way.)           You’re following the plan—and doing everything right.               And the scale just won’t budge.      


NEXT
 We get it— when your weight plateaus, it’s frustrating. (Like, put-your-scale-back-in-that-closet frustrating.)         Especially if you choose to only measure your success by the scale.   


NEXT
 We know what you’re thinking: "Didn’t Noom tell me to weigh myself every morning, first thing?"       Yes, and that’s definitely part of the plan—but just a part of it!           


NEXT
    It’s all about how you define success.    Though you may not always wake up to a lower number on the scale, you’re still making progress every day—in one way or another.         Part of staying motivated is finding new ways to measure your progress.    (And so is finding even more things to do with cauliflower.)


I BELIEVE
 Progress can be lots of different things, so try to think about what it might look like for    you   .    
    <ul><li>Weight loss</li><li>Inches lost</li><li>More energy</li><li>Better sleep</li><li>Dropping a size in your jeans</li><li>Clothes fitting better</li><li>Working out longer</li><li>Exercising with more intensity</li><li>Fewer aches and pains</li></ul>    
Progress can be physical
    <ul><li>Feeling more confident.</li><li>Having less anxiety in uncomfortable situations.</li><li>Knowing when to enjoy something you’re craving.</li><li>Conquering a trigger.</li><li>Changing a thought distortion.</li><li>Eating a mindful meal.</li><li>Making healthy choices.</li><li>Feeling good about your life.</li></ul>    
Progress can be psychological
    <ul><li>Making time for more fun outings and events.</li><li>Receiving compliments.</li><li>Turning down treats at work.</li><li>Meeting a friend for tennis.</li><li>Saying no to a food pusher (or stale party chips)</li><li>Getting your family and friends to try some healthy habits.</li></ul>    
Progress can be social
    <ul><li>Meal prepping for the week.</li><li>Taking the stairs more often.</li><li>Cooking a new recipe.</li><li>Bringing your lunch to work.</li><li>Trying a new healthy food.</li><li>Cooking at home instead of eating out</li><li>Craving vegetables (even bok choy).</li><li>Walking more steps than ever before.</li></ul>    
Progress can be the little things that add up
 Just remember: If you’re making progress on some of these items, eventually the scale    will    move.    


DONE
 Now choose four new ways to measure your success: one physical, one psychological, one social, and one little thing that adds up—like trying a new recipe every week. (Or just being willing to eat Brussels sprouts.)        Then remind yourself that these four things are propelling you toward YBP, even if the scale won’t budge.

 It’s:    F. None of the above.    While healthy eating can be expensive, time-consuming, bland, and inconvenient, it doesn’t have to be any of those things. And if it is, we can help with all that.    


NEXT
    Healthy food is really expensive.          It’s a hassle to eat something healthy.          Cooking at home takes forever.          It’s impossible to make something healthy and delicious.          These are some pretty common thought distortions. They keep our old habits going, and prevent us from building new, healthy ones—and from learning how to peel an artichoke.          


YES
 So, how do you overcome these thought distortions? With some practical tips. (And a little bit of paprika.)       Ready to learn?   


NEXT
 Thought distortion:    Healthy food is really expensive.      Practical tip #1: Cut costs       
     Dining out is expensive. (And not always healthy.) The money you spend on one restaurant meal could cover a few days of groceries. Make eating out the exception, not the rule.        
Cook at home
 Find coupons online or in the mail. There are tons of deals out there, it’s just a matter of putting in a little work.   
Be thrifty
 Different stores offer the same foods at varying prices. Shop around for the best deals—and look online for sales so you know where to shop first.   
Know your stores
 Frozen produce is often cheaper than fresh. Plus, frozen produce never spoils. (Because it’s, uh, frozen.)   
Try frozen
         When fruits and vegetables are in season, they’re usually less expensive—and tastier. (And who doesn’t like better, cheaper produce?)      
Eat seasonally
 Meat, poultry, seafood, and produce can get expensive, especially when they come from halfway around the world. Local ingredients (like from a Farmer’s Market) can taste better    and    be a better deal—plus you’re supporting your neighbors.      
Buy local
     Buy nonperishables like oats, quinoa, nuts, and seeds in bulk to save some cash. (But not cabinet space.)      
Bulk up
     Sometimes, discount warehouses offer great deals on certain items. Could be worth a look.      
Think big
     Feeling extra motivated? Plant some zucchini in your yard. Feeling extra motivated in a studio apartment? Buy a tiny basil plant.      
Grow your greens


NEXT
 Thought distortion:    It’s a hassle to eat something healthy.      Practical tip #2: Plan ahead       
 Running errands all day? Corner store lacking options? Stock your drawer, locker, or backpack with healthy meals and snacks for convenience when you need it.      
Be prepared
 In an ideal world, we’d prepare all our own foods (and know just how much butter is in that Chicken Makhani) but that’s not always an option. Make a list of nearby healthy restaurants so you don’t need to think when in a pinch.       
Identify your go-tos
 Pre-washed or frozen fruits and vegetables are great for a quick smoothie or side dish—just blend them, roast them, or serve them as-is. Frozen cauliflower rice, canned tuna, and peanut butter are also here to make your life easier. (But not all at once. Please.)      
Choose stress-free staples
 You can’t always cook everything yourself. But your grocery store likely has some healthy meals you can eat right away (like premade soups, salads, and sandwiches) and other options you can throw in the oven (like meatloaf or casseroles). Find choices that appeal to you—just read the labels first.       
Find some quick options
 When you cook a recipe, double it. Then you’ll have food for several meals throughout the week. You could even triple that turkey chili and freeze some for another time.       
Double up
 Having family and friends who are supportive of your journey (rather than blockers) is crucial. If your support system is willing to try new healthy restaurants with you, eat some of the same foods that you are, or even help with the shopping, then your food environment will be healthier naturally.      
Tap into your support system


NEXT
 Thought distortion:    Cooking at home takes forever.      Practical tip #3: Do more with less time       
 Staring in your fridge each night, wondering what to make for dinner? Choose a day to plan out your meals for the week. (While you’re at it, pick a backup day too.)      
Plan ahead
 Make a grocery list and stick to it. You’ll be in and out of the store in a flash—especially if you use those shopping Psych Tricks.   
Make a list
 Wash, cut, and put away veggies at the beginning of the week so that they’re ready to snack on, throw in a salad, or add to a stir-fry.       
Prep it
 Shortcuts are your friend. Buying peeled and deveined shrimp doesn’t make you lazy. It makes you shrimp tacos—fast.       
Choose stress-free staples
 Buy nonperishables you love in bulk, like rice, dried lentils, and pistachios. You’ll always have something to cook, and you’ll save a trip or two to the store.      
Bulk up
 Cooking doesn’t have to be a big production. Let a slow cooker simmer that pozole for you. Or whip up a sheet-pan dinner or a one-pot meal that can roast or simmer while you do something else around the house—like relax.       
Dust off that slow cooker
 While fresh foods are always a good idea, canned foods can save you time, money, and stress. Try sardines, black beans, and diced tomatoes. (Watch for added salt, sugar, and fat, though.)      
Stock some canned goods
 If you have housemates or family around, turn them into your sous chefs. (Or at least get their help with the dishes.)    
Make it a family affair


DONE
 Thought distortion:    It’s impossible to make something healthy and delicious.       Practical tip #4: Make it tasty       
 You’d be surprised how a pinch of paprika or a dash of dill can transform the flavor of your food.   <ul><li>Spice up your meat, chicken, fish, or tofu with chili or cayenne for a kick.</li><li>Add fresh herbs to your salads for a brighter taste.</li><li>Roast sweet potato, squash, turnips, and carrots with rosemary and olive oil for a savory side—or cinnamon and nutmeg for a sweet snack.</li></ul>
Season your cooking
 Don’t like kale? Try collard greens. Not a fan of blueberries? Try pomegranate. Sometimes we get stuck in a rut, eating the same foods on repeat because we think they’re healthy or that we should be eating them, whether we like them or not. Don’t settle—keep trying new foods until your taste buds are happy. (That’s the addition mindset we talked about recently.)   
Try something new
 Keep enjoying the foods you love while making them just a little healthier. Use low-fat Greek yogurt instead of sour cream or mayonnaise. Sub zucchini noodles for traditional pasta. Swap brown rice for white rice. Or, quite simply, cut the oil a recipe calls for in half—after all, you’re in charge.   
Reinvent a recipe
 Small changes in the way you prepare your food can have a big impact on flavor.    <ul><li>Grill meat or vegetables to give them a smoky taste.</li><li>Roast vegetables in the oven for a caramelized flavor.</li><li>Cook grains in low-sodium beef, chicken, or vegetable stock to add richness.</li></ul>
Cook creatively
 Sometimes, it’s not about what you’re eating, but how you’re eating it. Pairing sweet and salty foods—or mixing crunchy, creamy, and crumbly textures—can make your meals more satisfying.          Some examples? Serve grilled pork chops with applesauce, or top a small bowl of yogurt with toasted almonds and raspberries.   
Pair perfectly

D. Inconvenient.
E. All of the above.
F. None of the above.
 It’s:    F. None of the above.    While healthy eating can be expensive, time-consuming, bland, and inconvenient, it doesn’t have to be any of those things. And if it is, we can help with all that.

YES
 So, how do you overcome these thought distortions? With some practical tips. (And a little bit of paprika.)       Ready to learn?   


NEXT
 Thought distortion:    Cooking at home takes forever.      Practical tip #1: Do more with less time       
 Staring in your fridge each night, wondering what to make for dinner? Choose a day to plan out your meals for the week. (While you’re at it, pick a backup day too.)      
Plan ahead
 Make a grocery list and stick to it. You’ll be in and out of the store in a flash—especially if you use those shopping Psych Tricks.   
Make a list
 Wash, cut, and put away veggies at the beginning of the week so that they’re ready to snack on, throw in a salad, or add to a stir-fry.       
Prep it
 Shortcuts are your friend. Buying peeled and deveined shrimp doesn’t make you lazy. It makes you shrimp tacos—fast.       
Choose stress-free staples
 Buy nonperishables you love in bulk, like rice, dried lentils, and pistachios. You’ll always have something to cook, and you’ll save a trip or two to the store.      
Bulk up
 Cooking doesn’t have to be a big production. Let a slow cooker simmer that pozole for you. Or whip up a sheet-pan dinner or a one-pot meal that can roast or simmer while you do something else around the house—like relax.       
Dust off that slow cooker
 While fresh foods are always a good idea, canned foods can save you time, money, and stress. Try sardines, black beans, and diced tomatoes. (Watch for added salt, sugar, and fat, though.)      
Stock some canned goods
 If you have housemates or family around, turn them into your sous chefs. (Or at least get their help with the dishes.)    
Make it a family affair


NEXT
 Thought distortion:    It’s a hassle to eat something healthy.      Practical tip #2: Plan ahead       
 Running errands all day? Corner store lacking options? Stock your drawer, locker, or backpack with healthy meals and snacks for convenience when you need it.      
Be prepared
 In an ideal world, we’d prepare all our own foods (and know just how much butter is in that Chicken Makhani) but that’s not always an option. Make a list of nearby healthy restaurants so you don’t need to think when in a pinch.       
Identify your go-tos
 WPre-washed or frozen fruits and vegetables are great for a quick smoothie or side dish—just blend them, roast them, or serve them as-is. Frozen cauliflower rice, canned tuna, and peanut butter are also here to make your life easier. (But not all at once. Please.)      
Choose stress-free staples
 You can’t always cook everything yourself. But your grocery store likely has some healthy meals you can eat right away (like premade soups, salads, and sandwiches) and other options you can throw in the oven (like meatloaf or casseroles). Find choices that appeal to you—just read the labels first.       
Find some quick options
 When you cook a recipe, double it. Then you’ll have food for several meals throughout the week. You could even triple that turkey chili and freeze some for another time.       
Double up
 Having family and friends who are supportive of your journey (rather than blockers) is crucial. If your support system is willing to try new healthy restaurants with you, eat some of the same foods that you are, or even help with the shopping, then your food environment will be healthier naturally.      
Tap into your support system


NEXT
 Thought distortion:    Healthy food is really expensive.      Practical tip #3: Cut costs       
     Dining out is expensive. (And not always healthy.) The money you spend on one restaurant meal could cover a few days of groceries. Make eating out the exception, not the rule.        
Cook at home
 Find coupons online or in the mail. There are tons of deals out there, it’s just a matter of putting in a little work.   
Be thrifty
 Different stores offer the same foods at varying prices. Shop around for the best deals—and look online for sales so you know where to shop first.   
Know your stores
 Frozen produce is often cheaper than fresh. Plus, frozen produce never spoils. (Because it’s, uh, frozen.)   
Try frozen
         When fruits and vegetables are in season, they’re usually less expensive—and tastier. (And who doesn’t like better, cheaper produce?)      
Eat seasonally
 Meat, poultry, seafood, and produce can get expensive, especially when they come from halfway around the world. Local ingredients (like from a Farmer’s Market) can taste better    and    be a better deal—plus you’re supporting your neighbors.      
Buy local
     Buy nonperishables like oats, quinoa, nuts, and seeds in bulk to save some cash. (But not cabinet space.)      
Bulk up
     Sometimes, discount warehouses offer great deals on certain items. Could be worth a look.      
Think big
     Feeling extra motivated? Plant some zucchini in your yard. Feeling extra motivated in a studio apartment? Buy a tiny basil plant.      
Grow your greens


DONE
 Thought distortion:    It’s impossible to make something healthy and delicious.       Practical tip #4: Make it tasty       
 You’d be surprised how a pinch of paprika or a dash of dill can transform the flavor of your food.   <ul><li>Spice up your meat, chicken, fish, or tofu with chili or cayenne for a kick.</li><li>Add fresh herbs to your salads for a brighter taste.</li><li>Roast sweet potato, squash, turnips, and carrots with rosemary and olive oil for a savory side—or cinnamon and nutmeg for a sweet snack.</li></ul>
Season your cooking
 Don’t like kale? Try collard greens. Not a fan of blueberries? Try pomegranate. Sometimes we get stuck in a rut, eating the same foods on repeat because we think they’re healthy or that we should be eating them, whether we like them or not. Don’t settle—keep trying new foods until your taste buds are happy. (That’s the addition mindset we talked about recently.)   
Try something new
 Keep enjoying the foods you love while making them just a little healthier. Use low-fat Greek yogurt instead of sour cream or mayonnaise. Sub zucchini noodles for traditional pasta. Swap brown rice for white rice. Or, quite simply, cut the oil a recipe calls for in half—after all, you’re in charge.   
Reinvent a recipe
 Small changes in the way you prepare your food can have a big impact on flavor.    <ul><li>Grill meat or vegetables to give them a smoky taste.</li><li>Roast vegetables in the oven for a caramelized flavor.</li><li>Cook grains in low-sodium beef, chicken, or vegetable stock to add richness.</li></ul>
Cook creatively
 Sometimes, it’s not about what you’re eating, but how you’re eating it. Pairing sweet and salty foods—or mixing crunchy, creamy, and crumbly textures—can make your meals more satisfying.          Some examples? Serve grilled pork chops with applesauce, or top a small bowl of yogurt with toasted almonds and raspberries.   
Pair perfectly
DONE
Treat yourself

Next
 We’ve talked about the importance of rewards—from gold stars to slow claps—quite a bit.           Rewards are a form of positive reinforcement, which helps keep you motivated, which ultimately leads to results.            Sounds familiar, right?   


TRUE
 Today, you’re going to treat yourself to a little reward.        Don’t feel like you’ve earned it? Sorry to break it to you, but you absolutely have.          Rewards reinforce behaviors. And when we reinforce behaviors, we build habits.          An important habit is showing up to Noom each day. Which you did! You read through a lesson or two, and maybe even learned a few things. You have most certainly earned a reward.   


DONE
 We’d love to tell you that this is the birth of a beautiful daily ritual where we tell you to go out and treat yourself to a sunset walk or new novelty keychain. But rewards are like surprise parties: they work best when you don’t expect them.         Psychologists (like us) call this an    intermittent reward schedule   , and it’s a great way to influence behavior.        So from time to time, when you least expect it, we’ll use this little Psych Trick on you. And today is that day.        We won’t do this often—and who knows when we’ll do it next—so be sure to make your reward count.       Now go ahead and treat yourself. You deserve it.

Learn to breathe

OKAY
         Close your mouth, then inhale through your nose for one, two, three, four.      


MAYBE
 Now open your mouth and exhale for four, three, two, one.       Do you feel that?   


NEXT
 Your breath.        We know what you’re thinking:    Why is Noom making me breathe like this?          Well, we have a good reason. Promise.   


NEXT
 People have been studying our breath for ages.        And guess what? Breathing is fascinating—and pretty strange. It’s both involuntary and voluntary.        This means that breathing occurs even when we don’t think about it. (Phew.)       But, you    can    control your breath, if you choose. 


NEXT
 Another good thing about your breath: It’s totally portable.        While it might not be realistic to put your feet in the sand or take an ice-cold shower in the middle of your workday, you can always take a deep breath when you’re starting to feel a little anxious.        Plus, your breath is probably the only thing you can’t forget at home. (Aside from your body, of course.)   


NEXT
 This kind of breathing exercise has lots of short-term and long-term benefits. Besides, you know, keeping you alive.          
 Breathing exercises slow down your breath, lower your heart rate, get those calming hormones flowing, and bring you into the present.    
Short-term: Activates your parasympathetic nervous system
 Research shows that when done consistently, breathing exercises can lower stress, relieve tension, and have lots of other positive effects.       Now let’s practice some breathing. (Well, you’re already breathing. You know what we mean.)   
Long-term: Reduces stress, anxiety, and more


LET'S BREATHE
 We’ve got three breathing exercises for you to try out: One for the body, one for the mind, and one for the spirit.        They’re all grounding activities you can try this week as your Daily Activity. And each one takes only about a minute.        What do you say?   


NEXT
For your body: Falling-out breath       The falling-out breath is a great way to release physical tension in your body. (More of that, please.)      <ol><li>Take a deep breath in, filling your lungs as much as possible.</li><li>At the top of your breath, take one more sip of air.</li><li>Exhale with a big, noisy sigh (something like “HHHAAAAA”) as you release all that air from your lungs.</li></ol>


NEXT
For your mind: Box breath       The box breath is a helpful tool to feel more present. And who doesn’t want that?      <ol><li>Inhale to the count of four. </li><li>Hold your breath at the top to the count of four. </li><li>Exhale to the count of four. </li><li>Hold your breath at the bottom to the count of four.</li></ol>


DEEP BREATH
For your spirit: Emptying breath        The emptying breath helps you turn on that parasympathetic nervous system, so you can feel calmer, sooner.      <ol><li>Inhale to the count of three. </li><li>Exhale slowly to the count of six, focusing on releasing as much air as you can.</li></ol> Not so hard, right?   
DEEP BREATH
Let go of limits

 Ever get stuck focusing on "can’t"s, "won’t"s, and "what-if"s?               Yep, thought distortions again.           <embed alt="day13-welcomeB.png" embedtype="image" format="left" id="4259"/>              Try not to worry about things that might happen.    Obstacles will come your way, but there's no need to anticipate them or see them as stopping points.    (Really, there's no way of knowing if they'll even show up at all.)               Focus on setting goals and chasing them—that’s hard enough work.    Then, tackle any challenge only when it comes up—and feel free to use those Psych Tricks.

Demystify any menu

I’M READY
 A lot of people feel unmotivated because they think losing weight means missing out on happy hours, pizza nights, and game days at the bar.                  But, you’re not on a diet—you’re changing for the long haul.    This means you can    absolutely    say yes to after-work events, pizza, and football. (And the occasional jalapeño popper, pizza popper, and slice of jalapeño pizza.)              The key is knowing how to order when you’re out to eat.    And, wow, isn’t that convenient: We happen to have four useful tips to help you do just that.   
 Here’s a little quiz to get us started.    Which food is the most calorie-dense?
NEXT
A. French fries.
B. Mashed potatoes.
C. Roasted potatoes.
D. Baked potatoes.
 It’s:    A. French fries      .         


GOT IT
Tip #1: Mind your methods       It’s not just what you’re eating, it’s how it’s prepared.               Take the humble potato. It doesn’t need to be the centerpiece of your diet—but if it’s served baked with a side of broccoli and the protein of your choice, you’ve got yourself a nice little meal.       Cut that potato up into strips and fry it in a vat of oil, and we’ve got a different story.           
    <ul><li>Deep-fried</li><li>Pan-fried</li><li>Candied </li><li>Dehydrated (this process removes the water, making it more calorie-dense)</li></ul>    
Less healthy methods
    <ul><li>Sautéed</li><li>Seared</li><li>Cured</li><li>Stir-fried</li><li>Toasted</li><li>Blackened</li><li>Grilled</li><li>Charbroiled</li><li>Roasted</li></ul>    
Healthier methods
    <ul><li>Steamed</li><li>Broiled</li><li>Baked</li><li>Blanched</li><li>Poached</li><li>Stewed</li><li>Sous vide</li></ul>    
Healthiest methods
 Which chicken breast has the lowest CD?    
NEXT
A. Crispy chicken breast.
B. Golden chicken breast.
C. Pan-fried chicken breast.
D. Baked chicken breast.
 It’s:    D. Baked chicken breast      .    Crispy, golden, and pan-fried all mean the same thing: fried. (Very sneaky. Very sneaky, indeed.)   


WHAT'S NEXT?
Tip #2: Watch your words       Pay close attention to how a dish is described on a menu.    The words can shine some light on how it’s prepared—and what other types of ingredients are in it.   
    <ul><li>Light</li><li>Healthy</li><li>Fresh</li><li>Rubbed</li><li>Marinated</li><li>Spiced</li><li>Seasoned</li><li>Multigrain</li><li>Whole-grain</li><li>Vinaigrette</li><li>Red sauce</li></ul> Some of these terms are    relative.    A light Alfredo sauce might have fewer calories than a traditional Alfredo sauce. But how light is it, really? And do we actually want to order that pasta and find out?          
Healthier preparations
    <ul><li>Creamy</li><li>White sauce</li><li>Au gratin</li><li>Battered</li><li>Crunchy</li><li>Breaded</li><li>Golden</li><li>Glazed</li><li>BBQ</li><li>Rich</li><li>Stuffed</li><li>Crispy</li><li>Tempura</li><li>Bottomless</li><li>Loaded</li><li>Cheesy</li></ul>    
Heavier preparations
 Which appetizer is the healthiest?   
NEXT
A. Boneless chicken wings.
B. Mozzarella sticks.
C. Minestrone soup.
D. Nachos.
E. Caesar salad.
 It’s:    C. Minestrone soup      .    (A water-rich food full of water-rich foods. Also known as soup inception.)   


NEXT
Tip #3: Know your starters    Spinach and artichoke dip? Queso fundido? Egg rolls?        They’re called “starters,” but if you ask us, they should really be called “calorie goal enders.” (No? They shouldn’t? Alright, fine. Swing and a miss!)           While many appetizers can be sneaky, there are usually options with low caloric density. So, aim for Noom green foods.           Minestrone, for example, is a great one: low CD and packed with vegetables. And    studies show that people who begin their meal with a broth-based soup eat fewer calories overall than people who don’t.            So when you’re in the mood for a starter…           
    <ul><li>Simple salads with dressing on the side</li><li>Seaweed salad</li><li>Broth-based soups like pho and miso—they’re scientifically proven to fill you up</li><li>Edamame (soybeans)</li><li>Summer rolls</li><li>Grilled vegetables</li><li>Ceviche</li><li>Lettuce wraps</li><li>Chicken satay</li><li>Shrimp cocktail </li><li>Smoked salmon</li><li>Hummus and veggies</li></ul>    
Seek out
    <ul><li>Chicken wings</li><li>Creamy dips</li><li>Potato skins</li><li>Cheese boards</li><li>Falafel </li><li>Samosas</li><li>Fried potstickers</li><li>Quesadillas</li><li>Nachos</li><li>Mozzarella sticks</li><li>Egg rolls</li><li>Jalapeño poppers</li><li>Sliders</li><li>Onion rings</li></ul>    
Just sample
 Restaurant meals are typically:   
NEXT
A. Calorie-dense.
B. Twice the size of standard portions. (At least you have lunch for tomorrow.)
C. High in salt.
D. Either A or B.
E. All of the above.
F. None of the above.
 It’s:    E. All of the above. Restaurant meals are typically calorie-dense, high in salt, and double the appropriate serving size—at least.      


NEXT
Tip #4: Just Ask    Knowing your cooking methods, words, and starters will only get you so far.    The only way to really know what's going into a dish is to ask (which we promise isn’t as awkward as it sounds).           Pasta primavera is good until you’re served a pound of it. Edamame’s great until it’s fried.        After all,    most restaurants cook their meals with one thing in mind: taste.    Unfortunately, sugar, oil, and salt are easy ways to make something flavorful. But they’re not necessary.      For help deciding what to do and what to ask, look to the steps of the cooking process.<ul><li>   Seasoning:    Choose dishes that go big on herbs and spices, easy on the sugar and salt. </li><li>   Preparation:    Skip the added oils if you can, or at least aim for a lighter drizzle.</li><li>   Dressing:    Ask for the sauce on the side.</li><li>   Finishing:    Pass on fancy oil swirls, excessive croutons, and cheese sprinklings. </li></ul> One thing to remember: Just like it’s okay to make tons of alterations, it’s also okay to eat fun foods from time to time.           


I'VE GOT THIS
 Before your next dinner out, let’s consolidate what we’ve learned. (And all agree to pass on the mystery “light Alfredo.”)    When reading a menu:<ol><li>Mind your methods.</li><li>Watch your words.</li><li>Know your starters.</li><li>Just ask.</li></ol> You can also use Noom’s food database to learn more about the dishes served at popular restaurants.          
I'VE GOT THIS
     Pop quiz time.              Which is a reason why rewards are important?      
NEXT
A. They boost the chances you’ll act a certain way.
B. They help form new habits.
C. They lower the chances you’ll act a certain way.
D. Both A and B.
E. They’re surprises.
 It’s:    D. Both A and B      .    Rewards are a form of positive reinforcement, which encourages you to act a certain way, ultimately forming new habits.       
Choose rewards to keep you motivated

ANY IDEAS?
You’ve learned that rewards (which are consequences in the behavior chain) can be a great tool to build new habits.         Remember that intermittent reward schedule—how    rewards are best when they’re like surprise parties, unexpected and infrequent   ?        Well, when you are rewarded    every single time    you do something, you don't internalize the action—you're just doing it for the reward. And when the reward goes away? So does the behavior.       Ever get a shout-out from your supervisor after a tough shift? Felt pretty good, we bet. But what if your boss sang your praises every time you clocked out? After a while, their compliments would start to ring hollow, and you'd take them for granted. So they'd no longer really be rewarding.       That’s what we’re talking about.          So, while we don’t want to rely on compliments (and all those other prizes) too much to change our habits, we do want to keep a few rewards in our back pockets.              


NEXT
 Why yes! There’s an endless supply of rewards in the world;    it’s really a matter of finding the ones that mean something to you.               To help you brainstorm (or pick and choose), we have    four rewards categories for you: tangible objects, self-care, socializing, and investments in your health.             Let’s start with tangible rewards—things you can touch, use, or do something with.               Some ideas:          
    <ul><li>A bathrobe (or, you know, regular clothes)</li><li>A smartwatch</li><li>Subscription boxes—they have them for everything from cheese to razors to books to succulents</li><li>A new audiobook </li><li>A weighted blanket</li></ul>    
Tangible rewards
    <ul><li>A magazine subscription</li><li>An e-reader (or some old-fashioned books)</li><li>A house plant</li><li>Vintage records</li><li>Fuzzy socks</li><li>Wireless headphones</li></ul>    
More tangible rewards


NEXT
    Self-care rewards offer you a chance to take care of yourself—no cucumber-slice eye mask required.    (Although those are pretty refreshing.)   
    <ul><li>Enjoy a bubble bath.</li><li>Take a nap. Maybe even a long one.</li><li>Meditate.</li><li>Watch the game.</li><li>Read a book.</li><li>Kick back in front of a movie.</li><li>Get a massage.</li><li>Turn that phone off for a few hours.</li></ul>    
Self-care rewards
    <ul><li>Clean out your garage. (Don’t knock it until you’ve tried it.)</li><li>Jump in the ocean.</li><li>Take a scenic drive.</li><li>Bang the drums.</li><li>Acupuncture.</li><li>Make a pot of tea.</li></ul>    
More self-care rewards


NEXT
    You can also reward yourself by socializing.    (No, hanging with your inner elephant doesn’t count.)   
    <ul><li>Go to a movie.</li><li>Drop into a party.</li><li>Host a brunch.</li><li>Hang at your favorite bar.</li><li>Plan a beach day.</li><li>Go to a comedy show.</li><li>Play mini-golf. Or even regular golf. </li></ul>    
Social rewards
    <ul><li>Try an escape room.</li><li>Play paintball.</li><li>Watch live music.</li><li>Go for a picnic in the park.</li><li>Meet a friend for coffee or a drink. </li></ul>    
More social rewards


NEXT
    Next, healthy rewards can be fun, too.    Maybe you can even get those meal-prep containers you’ve been eyeing.   
    <ul><li>Enjoy dinner at a healthy restaurant.</li><li>Sign up for a new workout class.</li><li>Splurge on a personal training session.</li><li>Buy a reusable water bottle.</li><li>Sign up for that 5K.</li></ul>    
Healthy rewards
    <ul><li>Get a gym membership.</li><li>Try a healthy meal service.</li><li>Buy an immersion blender.</li><li>Order new running shoes.</li><li>Pick out a road bike.</li><li>Invest in at-home gym equipment.</li><li>Find an interesting cookbook.</li><li>Upgrade your yoga mat.</li></ul>    
More healthy rewards


I COMMIT
 Now your challenge is to choose a few rewards to use—intermittently, of course. You can use the fields below to type yours in, or make note of them anywhere else that will help them stay top of mind.   
My tangible reward is…
Please enter your tangible reward (e.g., a weighted blanket)
(enter your tangible reward)
My self-care reward is…
Please enter your self-care reward (e.g., a massage)
(enter your self-care reward)
My social reward is…
Please enter your social reward (e.g., checking out a comedy show)
(enter your social reward)
My healthy reward is…
Please enter your healthy reward (e.g., a cool new cookbook)
(enter your healthy reward)
        Now, next time we ask you to reward yourself, instead of reaching for Gouda or mochi ice cream, be prepared to reach for a weighted blanket or lavender-scented bath bomb. Whatever gets you going.

Bundle your temptations

TELL ME MORE
 We all know we should do healthy things. But how do you find the motivation to do things when you just don’t feel like it?               A study by the University of Pennsylvania looked into just that. (And came up with a surprisingly cozy-sounding solution.)    


WHO?
 The study investigated how to get people to hit the gym.        These bookworms (actually, they’re just people who responded to recruitment ads) were separated into three groups.    <ul><li>Group one received four oh-so-tempting audiobooks they could only access at the gym.</li><li>Group two received the same four audiobooks but could listen anywhere—although it was recommended they enjoy the books only at the gym.</li><li>Group three received a $25 gift card and was encouraged to work out more.</li></ul> Guess who went to the gym the most?          


GO ON
    Group one, the participants who could only listen to the audiobooks at the gym, went to the gym the most.    They worked out a whopping 51% more than those who were given a gift card and encouragement to work out more (group three). Group two, who had access to the audiobooks at any time, exercised 29% more than the gift card group.          Dr. Katherine Milkman, who conducted the study, refers to this as    “temptation bundling.”    (See? Very cozy-sounding.)          


NEXT
    Temptation bundling    is pairing something that gives us instant gratification (like taking a hot bath or watching viral sports videos) with something we “should” be doing that’s less fun (like organizing our junk drawer or doing sit-ups).        In other words,    temptation bundling is the smooshing together of something you    want    to do and something you    ought    to do.

Temptation bundling works in two ways:<ol><li>You spend less time on your temptations—they’re not available round the clock.</li><li>When you do have access to your temptation, you’re more likely to do what you should be doing, because you get to enjoy your temptation, too.</li></ol> You’re taming your inner elephant while you build a new habit.    And over time, your “should” behavior can become your “want” behavior.          Hat tip to psychology.               


NEXT
Here are three ways you can use temptation bundling to improve your health:<ol><li>That game you can’t stop playing on your phone? You now only play it while on the stationary bike.</li><li>That fancy latte? Yours, but you have to walk to the coffee shop and back.</li><li>Listen to a true-crime podcast while you pack your lunches for the week. </li></ol>
 4. Catch up on your group texts only while you walk on a treadmill.     5. Scroll social media while standing up.

DONE
 Now it’s your turn to build a temptation bundle. (Way better than a cable bundle.)            Remember, you need to batch something that gives you instant gratification with some kind of chore.          1. Create two lists.<ul><li>   Want list:    all the things you want to be doing—like playing video games or listening to music.</li><li>   Should list:    all the things you should be doing—like sitting less or cleaning out your junk drawer.</li></ul>2. Then build your bundles.<ul><li>Pair one want and one should together, then repeat.</li></ul>        Now go have some fun—while getting those to-dos done.

Quick Motivational Tip #5

QUESTIONS?
 You know who asks a lot of questions? We do!           Now you’re going to learn to ask tons of questions, too—all to help you stay motivated.    Quick Motivational Tip #5: Ask questions        When your inner elephant starts asking for mochi ice cream—and lots of it—take a moment to pause and ask yourself some questions. Not only will this give your rider a chance to weigh in and hopefully take control, but it will help calm your elephant (and their hankering for sweet treats).

 Think of the 5 Ws: who, what, where, when, why. (And how.)           Before you grab that second slice of red velvet cake, ask yourself:      <ul><li>"Why am I reaching for seconds? Could I take a walk, have a hot tea, or call a friend instead?"</li><li>"How am I going to fit this into my calorie budget? Is there even any room?"</li></ul>    Before you pass on the gym, ask yourself:      <ul><li>"Who is telling me to skip weightlifting today? Is it my elephant again?"</li><li>"How will I feel later if I don’t work out now? Will I feel guilty if I skip? Or proud of myself if I go?"</li></ul>


ASKING AWAY
 Asking questions helps you:   <ul><li>Slow down—so you don’t make a split-second decision you regret.</li><li>Think rationally (not elephantine-ly).</li><li>Be self-aware.</li><li>Stay motivated to make better decisions—like getting in that workout even though you’re tired.</li></ul> So, the next time you’re about to do something you might regret—like storm eating a heap of cake, try asking the 5 Ws (and how).

Break down sabotaging thoughts

LET’S GO
 Since you’ve started Noom, you’ve learned a lot about reframing the frustrating thought distortions that made you feel skeptical about your journey or your ability to reach your weight loss goals.             At this point, you might be feeling more motivated than ever, but as you've learned, motivation ebbs and flows.         So, we’ve got a new Psych Trick to turn any negative or self-sabotaging thoughts that come up along the way to dust.   


NEXT
1. Remember a sabotaging thought you’ve had recently:<ul><li>   I have to finish everything on my plate.    </li><li>   I ate a salad for dinner, so I’m going to have tiramisu.   </li><li>   I’ve failed.   </li><li>   I never make it past three months of a weight loss plan.   </li><li>   Everyone thinks I’m no fun because I ordered soup for dinner.   </li><li>   I blew my budget…I might as well face-plant into a platter of kielbasa.    </li></ul>


NEXT
2. Now identify what type of thought distortion you’re dealing with:<ul><li>Is it all-or-nothing thinking? </li><li>Are you mind reading again? (“People will think it's strange if I order a salad.”)</li><li>Have you become a fortune-teller? (“Other plans haven't worked for me, so Noom won't work either.”) </li></ul>


NEXT
3. Next, write down all the evidence supporting this thought distortion: In what ways is this sabotaging thought true? Even if you don’t think there’s anything genuine about it, keep digging. There’s surely some grain of truth—it just might take a moment of brainstorming to get there.   


NEXT
4. Then, write down all the evidence against this thought:In what ways is this sabotaging thought false? Even if you think this is completely true, try looking at the thought from a few more angles. Maybe you think your friends are judging you for ordering soup—but do    you    judge your friends based on their dinner choices? (We’re guessing no.) 


GREAT
 Look at your list. See all those falses?        That’s why we call these thoughts    distortions   . We think they’re true, but when it comes down to it, they’re mostly false.       And now you know how to pick them apart—and that nobody cares what you order for dinner except for you. (And the sous-chef.)   


GOT IT
Here’s how Aditi picked apart her own thought distortion. Aditi stepped on the scale this morning and saw that she’d lost another pound. But she immediately thought: Yeah, but I lost weight the last time I tried, and that didn’t work. So this won’t work for me, either.        Then, Aditi picked apart her harsh thought.   <ol><li>   Sabotaging thought   : </li><ul><li>    I've lost that weight before. Ultimately, I’ll fail.      </li></ul><li>   Thought distortion   : </li><ul><li> Fortune-telling: She’s predicting the future. (And she’s a forensic accountant, not a psychic.)   </li></ul><li>   Evidence supporting her thought   : </li><ul><li> She’s lost weight in the past but gained it back.   </li></ul><li>   Evidence against her thought   :</li><ul><li> She’s tried different weight-loss programs, but this is her first time trying Noom.   </li><li> She’s changed her behaviors before for a little while but never figured out how to make new habits stick, and that’s something she’s working on now.   </li><li> This is the first time Aditi is figuring out how to stay motivated once the initial excitement wears off.   </li><li> She can’t predict the future. Nobody can. (But she’s pretty good at spotting padded expense accounts.)   </li></ul></ol>


I BELIEVE
 Turns out we don’t only have sabotaging thoughts when we slip. We also have them when we surge (like Aditi).       Even when you’re doing great—and enjoying a motivational high—thought distortions still pop up.        Why? Well, there are lots of potential reasons.          
 Maybe you’ve been burned before, and you’re just trying to protect yourself from being burned again.   <ul><li>Now, with Noom, you're creating new, successful experiences.</li></ul>
Past experiences
 Maybe the thought of failure has always scared you.    <ul><li>Now, you’re learning how to surge after a slip.</li></ul>
Fear of failure
 Perhaps you tend to underestimate your abilities, and you’ve always felt unsure you could take on a real lifestyle change.   <ul><li>Now, you’re building self-efficacy.</li></ul>
A lack of confidence
 Maybe you don’t think much of yourself right now, for any variety of reasons.   <ul><li>Now, you’re working toward goals that’ll make you proud.</li></ul>
Low self-esteem
 Quite possibly, you’re scared about what it would feel like to reach your goals.   <ul><li>Now, when you’re afraid, you just imagine YBP.</li></ul>
Most importantly, a fear of success


DONE
 You now know how to tear a thought distortion into tiny pieces—and throw it right in the trash where it belongs.       Hat tip to psychology.

 Since you’ve started Noom, you’ve learned a lot about reframing those frustrating thought distortions.

Here’s how Lamar picked apart his own thought distortion.    Last week, Lamar slept through his alarm and missed his morning run. I'm a failure, he thought.    Then, Lamar deconstructed this not-so-nice thought.    <ol><li>   Sabotaging thought   : </li><ul><li>    I'm a failure      </li></ul><li>   Thought distortions   : </li><ul><li> Labeling: He put a label on something (himself).

Reflect on and reinforce your wins

I’M READY
 You came here for a Psych Trick, right?              Good, because we’ve got one ready to go. (Will we ever run out of these? You’ll have to wait and see.)   


NEXT
 While some people will tell you there’s no sense in thinking about the past, they’re not quite right. (And they might not know about psychology.)       Noomers, meet your newest Psych Trick: reflect and reinforce. This tool will give you a chance to look back, acknowledge your successes, and even celebrate those stuffed bell peppers you made—all important parts of staying motivated.       Why, exactly?   


NEXT
 Well, ever been told that if you can believe it, you can achieve it? This rhyme, while a bit cheesy, has some truth to it.       Because that’s    self-efficacy.             And high self-efficacy leads to high motivation.    And it plays a huge part in whether or not you achieve your goals. (Which, we can all agree, is why you’re here.)       Thinking about (and celebrating) your wins boosts your self-efficacy because you acknowledge what you’ve gotten done and feel more confident in your ability to keep doing more. Doing this also makes you less likely to sabotage your thoughts—which can slow down your progress.          


DONE
 Go ahead and think back to all the victories you’ve had in the past two weeks, big or small.        Did you grocery shop in the morning to avoid crowds and decision fatigue? Pick apart a thought distortion? Finally learn how to cook asparagus?       Remember: Little triumphs count. Acknowledge your wins, and choose three to share with a friend, a neighbor—anybody who’ll listen.

Noom 202: The only 7 habits you need

LET’S GO
 Congratulations, you completed Noom 201! With three mini-courses under your belt, you’re ready to start building the habits you need to succeed long-term.                     The only 7 habits you need   —pretty bold statement, huh?                    But by the end of this mini-course, you'll be feeling just as bold as the title of this mini-course. Noom 202 takes an average of 6 to 9 days to complete. And once you're done, like the title suggests, you’ll be equipped with the only 7 habits you need to make sustainable changes to your diet and develop a more balanced relationship with all foods.                    Specifically, you’ll have…                 1. Befriended breakfast.    2. Learned to eat regularly.    3. Practiced controlling your portions.    4. Unprocessed your diet.    5. Lost the labels.    6. Ditched the drinks.    7. Practiced eating more mindfully.                 Ready to start hacking your eating habits?

Defining keystone habits

NEXT
 A habit is an acquired behavior that has become totally or mostly involuntary because you do it over and over again. In other words, a habit is something you do automatically—no thought (or batteries) required.               You make habits by repeating a behavior over and over and over to solidify your behavior chain.    


NEXT
 So, now you know how to define a habit. But what about a       keystone       habit?          A keystone is something that must come first for other things to successfully follow.    (A tortilla is a keystone for all those burrito fillings.)


SHOW ME
 So, a keystone habit is what you do to help other routines fall into place.           Think of it like the first domino you knock down—setting off a cascade. Except in this case, things aren’t falling down, they’re building up.           Need an example?   


NEXT
 One great keystone habit: meal prepping. (Plus, those containers are kind of cool.)           You make the time to prepare a few meals for the week, and suddenly, your week is that much easier. And healthier. And probably less expensive too.      


DONE
 At lunch, your coworkers are chowing down on takeout. This is a social trigger, but you’re prepared with your cool bento box.       Your meal-prepped lunch is full of green foods, with a touch of fun foods mixed in. You’re full, you’re satisfied, and you feel pretty good! And when you need that afternoon pick-me-up, you have the carrots, crackers, and hummus you brought from home so you can steer clear of whatever’s in that vending machine.        How’d you do it?        Simple: That keystone habit of meal prepping made it easier for you to uphold another good habit—sticking to healthy, low-CD meals.   
DONE
 True or false? You should never miss breakfast.      
NEXT
A. True
B. False
 It’s:    A. True      .    Let us explain.      


NEXT
 While there’s no such thing as the most important meal of the day (that’s a myth created by the big pancake lobby), we believe that breakfast is one you shouldn’t miss.        We know that eating    more meals    when you’re trying to    lose weight    might seem a little counterintuitive. After all, the theory is that you need to eat fewer calories to lose weight. So if you skip breakfast, you’ll consume fewer calories. And then you’ll lose weight. Right?       Well, not exactly. Studies have shown that eating breakfast may actually help people stay slimmer. (And be more fun at morning meetings, too.)          


NEXT
 Science tells us that breakfast matters.        In fact, the    American Journal of Clinical Nutrition    reports that    eating breakfast    reduces    how hungry you feel throughout the day.          And while eating breakfast may not directly cause weight loss, the Weight Loss Control Registry reports that people who have breakfast are better at keeping weight off in the long term.   


NEXT
 The benefits of breakfast go beyond their direct effects on your weight.      Many people who eat a balanced breakfast have a slew of    other    healthy habits that fend off weight gain, too. That’s a bonus benefit we can get behind.


WHAT’S FOR LUNCH?
 Let’s paint the picture. Say you skipped breakfast…        Now it’s 10:30 a.m. and your stomach is starting to rumble. You tell it to shush, but nope. You head to your favorite coffee shop and grab an iced chai latte. Oh, and a bagel. This gives you a second wind.        An hour later, you crash again. Well, at least it’s lunchtime.   


YIKES
 Wait, lunch? You completely forgot that, too. You didn’t even have time to eat breakfast. How could you have possibly had time to make a lunch plan?       While you work from home, your fridge is pretty much empty. And you’re totally slammed today.        You end up salvaging some vegetable gyoza from the very back of your freezer. Your side dish? Seven very-stale peanut butter pretzels.        Even though you skipped breakfast, by 2 p.m. you’ve eaten two calorie-dense meals. And you’re already hungry for pick-me-up number three.   


DONE
Keystone habit #1: Befriend breakfast       Though your veggie omelet isn’t magic,    eating a healthy breakfast sets the tone for your day      .               That’s why we’re telling you to befriend breakfast. Your first meal of the day is going to help you do a lot of other healthy things, too.           
DONE
Build your breakfast

LET’S DO IT
 Now that you know the importance of a solid breakfast, you need to figure out how to fill your plate. (Or your bowl. Or your cup. Or that traveling-blender-thermos thing.)   


NEXT
 What you eat for breakfast is up to you. But what we will tell you is that a balanced plate—a handful of green foods, a sprinkle of yellow foods, and a dash of orange foods—will keep you fuller as you go about your day.        And if you really don’t know what to eat for breakfast, consider the humble egg.        Scientists compared two groups of overweight or obese people: those who were placed on a calorie-restricted egg diet, and those who were on a similarly restricted bagel diet.    Each meal had the same total CD and number of calories, but the egg eaters lost more weight than the bagel group.          Researchers think the egg eaters lost more weight because eggs are high in protein. (Remember: Protein is the most satiating macronutrient.) Also, bagels are high in refined carbohydrates, which spike and drop your blood sugar, leaving you not so happy and very hungry.           


MAKES SENSE
 Still, even if there were a breakfast    guaranteed    to help you lose weight, we wouldn’t tell you to eat it.       Why not?       Well, we’re experts in psychology. But you’re the expert in you.       We’re here to give you the facts. We can help you choose what to eat—and when, and why—so you can reach your goals.           But only you can decide what works best for you.             
 So tell us, what size breakfast do you want?      
NEXT
A. Snack size: less than 150 calories.
B. Mini-meal: 150 to 300 calories.
C. Fuel meal: 300 to 450 calories.

 Reading about other people who’ve been where you’ve been—and have gone on to achieve their Super Goals—is a great way to get inspired.        And learning about other people’s journeys is a helpful reminder that this whole thing is a process. There will be ups and downs, big wins and real setbacks. (And there will also, quite likely, be cheese plates.)      After all, the    motivation model    is quite the roller coaster. And seeing how others came out on top can help you do the same.

 Meet Andrea.           <embed alt="day15-task5-3.png" embedtype="image" format="left" id="4358"/>          Andrea didn’t join Noom because she wanted to make major changes to her life. She just wanted a free smartwatch from her insurance company. (Andrea, can we get your insurance?)                 Two weeks into Andrea’s half-hearted attempt at Noom, Coach Julie gave her a tip: Kick off your day with some food.                       Andrea was a habitual breakfast skipper, but Julie let her know that she could start small—a piece of fruit, a hard-boiled egg, a small handful of nuts, whatever sounded most appealing.                       It seemed simple enough, so Andrea decided it couldn’t hurt to try.                 With that one little change, she began dropping weight. So Andrea figured she’d put more effort into the program. (Oh, hey, positive reinforcement.)      


NEXT
 Andrea did experience motivational slips and surges, of course. (We all do.) What kept her moving forward was the fact that the changes she made were minor, incremental, and on her schedule.      “I made small changes, which helped me feel really good, which inspired me to continue making these changes until they became    habits   . I got to a point where I decided I never wanted to feel tired, depressed, or unhappy ever again, so it’s worth it to keep up the healthy habits.”       Bravo, Andrea. Nice work befriending breakfast—and turning all those tiny changes into some life-changing habits.

Let's explore future-tripping    Have you ever had thoughts that go something like this?                     I’m not going to be able to make great food choices this week, and if I don’t, I’m probably going to gain weight, and if I gain weight, I’m not going to feel motivated to lose it again…              If this sounds at all familiar, you’re not alone. In fact, it’s a common thought distortion.            Which thought distortion do you think this is?      
NEXT
A. Ego-tripping
B. Guilt-tripping
C. Future-tripping
D. Wire-tripping
 It’s:    C. Future-tripping      .    Future-tripping means you’re worrying about tomorrow, instead of focusing on today. It’s a thought distortion that focuses on the future—the what-ifs, the what-thens, and everything in between.   


NEXT
 Sounds pretty unmindful, right? But the biggest problem is that future-tripping often becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. When you believe something is going to happen, you actually allow that expectation to influence what happens next. It’s not magic—it’s psychology.           <img alt="selffulfillingprophecy1" height="146" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/IB0P_23Kmgdn7GcL6oyubek7nbxw75kxsOFhiFInhaGMlTyH7JTu7SzYeUzyZdCujDqgi4YFWuzdU-B3ivIJXgZ0x7c1p3Y_iWwYH_BRDyxJy9L4aql-wpCMdJBDDZ8NV_IPOq3s" width="193"/>           A self-fulfilling prophecy often comes true because of the connection between our beliefs and our behaviors. It’s pretty simple, really: our beliefs cause us to take actions. And those actions lead to outcomes that confirm our beliefs.                             


SHOW ME THE PSYCH TRICK
 When future-tripping comes into the mix, worry puts this loop into overdrive and gets that downward spiral, well, spiraling.                  <img alt="worryselffulfillingprophecycycle" height="158" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/7k6Tk_PHI6HtFf2V252-nhf8T49Q60JrmxO9Se3pSGL3NBVZVSXBMnxwfkiW4aE7xIdsPhUe_wTsu6MzeQjgD1nhWN1cRAXcMjCZ5OHxvHdPZ0VKoZfVr5FqtgkCmMFY1QD_sAXj" width="209"/>                    We bet you’ve heard something like this before:  “Don’t worry about the future” or “It’ll all work out in the end.” But these statements aren’t actually helpful.            What's needed is a way to cut that future-tripping loop. And we’ve got a Psych Trick perfect for sending unwelcome worry packing.                 


PHEW
 Today's Psych Trick is called mental contrasting. Mental contrasting is about, well, contrasting—your future fears and your positive present. The idea is to pair your worry about the future with positive, true thoughts about the present.           For example, let’s say you’re worried about not having time to prepare healthier meals this week. You’ve been worrying about it all morning. But then you stop and think about the fact that you bought a couple of easy, microwaveable meals that'll keep you on track toward your health goals.           And just like that, your anxious feelings go down.                  


NEXT
 While there’s no tool or tip or trick for removing all fear about the future, mental contrasting can:           1. Reduce your anxiety about tomorrow.   2. Bring you back to the present.        To practice mental contrasting, next time you find yourself future-tripping, contrast that stress-inducing future with some of the amazing progress you’ve already made. Then, take a moment to reflect on how you feel.

Meet Erin

HEY ERIN
     Before we introduce you to your next keystone habit, we want you to meet a living, breathing example of this habit in action.              Meet Erin. She’s down 25 pounds and counting.           <embed alt="day16-task1-1.png" embedtype="image" format="left" id="4408"/>      


NEXT
 Six months into trying to lose weight on her own, Erin hit a plateau. No matter how many superfoods she ate, sprints she ran, or hours of sleep she got, she couldn’t get the scale to budge.        Frustrated yet determined, Erin decided she needed some extra support and guidance, so she turned to her coach, Tiffany.       Working closely with Tiffany, Erin made a discovery: She suffered from a terrible case of the       weekend problem   .   


NEXT
 Like many people, Erin had a relatively easy time staying on track during the week. (Think salads, sweat sessions, and plenty of sleep.)        Then weekends came around, and all bets were off.   


TELL ME
 Symptoms of the weekend problem absolutely differ from person to person. But in Erin’s case, every Saturday,    she would restrict her food intake all day long. Then, at night, she’d go out to eat, drink, and be (a little too) merry      .           Erin was stuck in a    repeating weekend fast-and-binge routine.          So what did Erin and Coach Tiffany do?   


NEXT
 They made a plan to break the cycle by helping    Erin develop one keystone habit:    eating regularly—especially on weekends.       Sounds simple, right? But it’s key to long-term, sustainable success.   


DONE
 And it worked.        Eating regularly solved Erin’s weekend problem. No longer ravenous by nighttime, she was able to break the fast-and-binge cycle. And don’t worry—Erin’s still tons of fun at parties.       “Noom really helped me to understand my relationship with food. I’ve learned to evaluate the situations that may put me at risk of not achieving my goals and find ways to get past them. It’s pulled me out of that plateau and has helped me reach all of my goals.”

The keys to keystone habits

TELL ME
 You recently learned your first keystone habit: Befriend breakfast. We hope you got today started with a nice, balanced meal. (And we don’t just mean balanced amounts of coffee and ice.)              Next up, we’ve got six more keystone habits to share with you, to make seven in all.          Each keystone habit is special   . Want to know why?      


NEXT
 At Noom, we’ve done quite a bit of work developing these foundational habits. And every one of our    seven keystone habits    is:   <ul><li>Rooted in    psychology   .</li><li>Supported by    sociology   .</li><li>Backed by    research   .</li></ul> Let’s take a closer look.   


NEXT
   1. Our seven keystone habits are rooted in psychology       We specialize in behavior change. (After all, we’re psychologists.)        One way to change how we behave is to retrain automatic habits—those behaviors that seemingly happen without any thought—by mapping out behavior chains to identify where to cut the links. (Snip, snip.)       This process is a lot of work, so we’ve selected    seven keystone habits    that will help just about everyone.    These habits will influence other habits automatically, without you having to think and without you needing to break another behavior chain.         (Think befriending breakfast    and    passing on that calorie-dense muffin on your way to work.)


NEXT
   2. Our seven keystone habits are supported by sociology       Why sociology?          Well, these habits have to work (and stick!) in real life.             That’s why Noom has a social component, too.           First, we have our awesome coaching team. They help us identify which keystone habits have been most helpful in triggering that cascade of other healthy habits.      We also have a special team we call “Getting to Know Our Users.” They socialize with Noomers like you throughout their journey to help us understand the secrets to lasting success. And they’re really good at what they do. (Talk about a dream job.)


NEXT
   3. Our seven keystone habits are backed by research       Every habit has been handpicked by our team of psychologists to help people lose weight.       We’ve also filtered out all the myths, urban legends, and downright lies to identify the habits that will actually help you keep the weight off    for good   . (No excessive cabbage soup slurped up on our watch.)       Where did we find these habits? Glad you asked. They come from…   <ul><li>Scientific journals (our favorite). </li><li>Tons of databases.</li><li>The National Weight Control Registry, which has tracked more than 10,000 people who have lost at least 30 pounds and kept it off for at least one year.</li></ul>


DONE
 So, our process is as simple as one, two, three.    Psychology. Sociology. Research.         Well,    your    process is that simple. We’re still catching our breath from developing this course.

 Let’s kick off this lesson with not one, but two questions.        First, have you heard that eating six small meals a day will speed up your metabolism?   
NEXT
A. Yes.
B. No.
C. Maybe so.

 And second, does eating six small meals a day actually speed up your metabolism?      
NEXT
A. Yes, for sure.
B. No way.
C. Didn’t I just answer this?



DARN
 Well, here’s the truth: This six-meals-a-day thing is a myth.        Our metabolism is often described as a furnace—it converts our food into energy to fuel our daily lives. So the (wrong) thinking goes, the more times a day you feed the fire, the faster it burns.          


NEXT
 Here are the facts:   <ul><li>   Metabolism    describes the process through which your body turns food and drink into energy.</li><li>   You’re continuously burning calories   —even when you’re sleeping. (Nice, right?) </li><li>Some primary determinants of your metabolic rate are    age, sex, and genetics.   </li><li>   Exercise and daily activities    also contribute to your total daily burn.</li></ul> Unfortunately, there’s no magic way to manipulate your baseline metabolism. You’ve got to work with what you’ve got. (Womp, womp.)

Keystone habit #2: Eat regularly We know that you already have a pretty regular eating schedule, but we wanted to apply some positive reinforcement to help you keep this healthy habit.            When you don’t eat regularly, your inner elephant can get loose—   and go wild, fast.    (Remember, play nice!)          Eating regularly is a keystone habit—and a Psych Trick—that can help you tame it.          How so? We’ve found that people who eat regularly are more likely to:   <ol><li>   Make healthier food choices.    Your elephant thinks two donuts and a fudge pop are an acceptable dinner.</li><li>   Eat at home.    When you’re super hungry, the last thing you want to do is watch water boil.</li><li>   Control food portions.    The more ravenous you are, the more likely you are to storm eat, or at least overserve yourself.</li><li>   Feel satisfied.    When you storm eat, you’re less likely to realize what you’ve consumed, leaving you unsatisfied, despite having blown your calorie budget.</li></ol>For these reasons alone, we’d recommend eating regularly. But there’s also science behind it.

 Eating regularly can help keep your blood sugar in check. When your blood sugar plummets, your body craves quick sources of energy, and these are often highly processed, calorie-dense foods (think: quick-digesting carbs like white bread, sugary treats, and savory snacks).   
Reason #1: Control your blood sugar
 Two words: appetite control.          The    Journal of Nutrition    found that    people who ate at least three times per day had lower levels of ghrelin (the “hunger hormone”) and were simply less hungry throughout the day.   
Reason #2: Keep your hunger hormones at bay
 Some studies suggest that    people who eat at least three times a day have higher levels of PYY (one of many “satiety” hormones).    So you feel more full.   
Reason #3: Get your satiety hormones in check
 People who eat more regularly can experience a lower postprandial insulin response. This means that    your body produces less insulin after you eat      .    Insulin is the key that allows glucose into your cells, and while it’s a form of energy, it can also be stored as fat if there's too much floating around.   
Reason #4: Reduce your insulin levels
 While eating more often won’t make you burn more calories, it may help you to burn more calories from fat. Research from the    British Journal of Nutrition    showed that    people who eat at least three meals per day burn more fat in a 24-hour period than those who eat just two meals.      
Reason #5: Fight the fat


DONE
 We know what you’re thinking. "Okay, okay, I get it. I'll keep eating regularly."                  But what exactly does regularly mean, anyway?       Check out your next lesson to find out… and learn practical ways to make it happen.

 Well, here’s the truth: This six-meals-a-day thing is a myth.        Our metabolism is often described as a furnace—it converts our food into energy to fuel our daily lives. So the (wrong) thinking goes, the more times a day you feed the fire, the faster it burns.          


NEXT
 Here are the facts:   <ul><li>   Metabolism    describes the process through which your body turns food and drink into energy.</li><li>   You’re continuously burning calories   —even when you’re sleeping. (Nice, right?) </li><li>Some primary determinants of your metabolic rate are    age, sex, and genetics.   </li><li>   Exercise and daily activities    also contribute to your total daily burn.</li></ul> Unfortunately, there’s no magic way to manipulate your baseline metabolism. You’ve got to work with what you’ve got. (Womp, womp.)

Keystone habit #2: Eat regularly    When you don’t eat regularly, your inner elephant can get loose—   and go wild, fast.    (Remember, play nice!)             Eating regularly is a keystone habit—and a Psych Trick—that can help you tame it.          How so? We’ve found that people who eat regularly are more likely to:   <ol><li>   Make healthier food choices   . Your elephant thinks two donuts and a fudge pop are an acceptable dinner.</li><li>   Eat at home   . When you’re super hungry, the last thing you want to do is watch water boil.</li><li>   Control food portions   . The more ravenous you are, the more likely you are to storm eat, or at least overserve yourself.</li><li>   Feel satisfied   . When you storm eat, you’re less likely to realize what you’ve consumed, leaving you unsatisfied, despite having blown your calorie budget.</li></ol>For these reasons alone, we’d recommend eating more regularly. But there’s also science behind it.


NEXT
 Reasons you might want to eat more regularly:   
 Eating regularly can help keep your blood sugar in check. When your blood sugar plummets, your body craves quick sources of energy, and these are often highly processed, calorie-dense foods (think: quick-digesting carbs like white bread, sugary treats, and savory snacks).   
Reason #1: Control your blood sugar
 Two words: appetite control.          The    Journal of Nutrition    found that    people who ate at least three times per day had lower levels of ghrelin (the “hunger hormone”) and were simply less hungry throughout the day.   
Reason #2: Keep your hunger hormones at bay
 Some studies suggest that    people who eat at least three times a day have higher levels of PYY (one of many “satiety” hormones).    So you feel more full.   
Reason #3: Get your satiety hormones in check
 People who eat more regularly can experience a lower postprandial insulin response. This means that    your body produces less insulin after you eat      .    Insulin is the key that allows glucose into your cells, and while it’s a form of energy, it can also be stored as fat if there's too much floating around.   
Reason #4: Reduce your insulin levels
 While eating more often won’t make you burn more calories, it may help you to burn more calories from fat. Research from the    British Journal of Nutrition    showed that    people who eat at least three meals per day burn more fat in a 24-hour period than those who eat just two meals.      
Reason #5: Fight the fat

 We know what you’re thinking: "Okay, okay, I get it. I'll start eating more regularly."    But what exactly does regularly mean, anyway?       Check out your next lesson to find out… and learn practical ways to make it happen.          
DONE
Meet the satiety scale

NEXT
 It’s true, we’ve said that eating regularly is important.                     But there’s a balance to it. And studies have shown that eating too often (think: six times per day) can actually make you hungrier.                 Why?                 When most people are on a calorie budget, splitting up calories over six meals prevents them from ever feeling satisfied after a meal.        Plus, eating often keeps food on the brain    all the time   . Which isn’t exactly ideal. After all, you’re trying to change your relationship with food and lose weight—not think about pain au lait all day.       


NEXT
 Eating regularly means eating often enough to:   <ul><li>Leave the table feeling satisfied.</li><li>Avoid getting hungry. Or angry. (You know the feeling.)</li><li>Keep your elephant in check.</li></ul> For some people, this might be two large meals a day. For others, this might be more, smaller meals—like three or four.       At the end of the day, you know yourself the best. So choose what satisfies your body the most.          


I REMEMBER
 Remember when we worked together to help make your calorie budget last?       You told us how much time you had to eat during the day, and whether you preferred eating large or small meals.      We told you what type of eater you were:    a Big Mealer, Classic Mealer, Eater on the Go, or Forager   . Then, we suggested how many meals and snacks to eat throughout the day.


NEXT
 Figuring out how much to eat—and when—was a great start. But now, let’s fine-tune your eating schedule and help you find your happy, satisfied medium—and start figuring out what “eating regularly” means to you.       Meet the Noom Satiety Scale:       1: remarkably ravenous (Why do I see a dancing quesadilla?)   2: horribly hungry   3: nothing but neutral   4: simply satisfied   5: fueled and fulfilled   6: searching for sweatpants   7: too full to function—think downing three desserts after an already-elaborate holiday dinner      


GOT IT
 We’ve determined that    the best range to help you feel satisfied and keep your calorie budget in check is between 3 (nothing but neutral) and 5 (fueled and fulfilled).          To set your unique satiety goal, figure out…       A. How you like to feel after a meal.    B. How you need to feel after a meal to tide you over until the next one.       The balance between A and B is how full you’re aiming to be after a meal. (A regular meal, of course. Not Thanksgiving dinner.)          


DONE
 So, what will your satiety goal be?       3: nothing but neutral     4: simply satisfied     5: fueled and fulfilled       How will you know when you’ve reached your satiety goal? Think about what your body’s cues will be. What are the physical sensations you’ll feel? Will you still be wearing real pants?        That’s your sweet spot.                    
DONE
Treat yourself

I REMEMBER
 Earlier in the course, you chose four rewards to help keep you motivated.                     Remember the reward types? Here’s a refresher:   <ul><li>   Tangible rewards    like a new audiobook, a pair of shoes, or a lottery ticket.</li><li>   Self-care rewards    like journaling, treating yourself to coffee, or enjoying a scenic car ride.</li><li>   Social rewards    like going to a movie, enjoying live music, or hosting a party.</li><li>   Healthy rewards    like dining at a healthy restaurant, signing up for a new fitness class, or buying a new cookbook.</li></ul>    


TREATING MYSELF
 Well, now’s the time to pick a gift from your metaphorical reward table. (Yes, like a very elaborate birthday party.)       What will it be? A new book? Tickets to a ball game? A scenic walk? A night out with some old friends?       Ask yourself what you need, then go for it. After all, you’ve earned it.   
TREATING MYSELF
Test yourself

QUIZ ME
 You just treated yourself. Now it’s time to test yourself.              Ready?   
 1. A keystone habit is:      
NEXT
A. Any healthy habit.
B. A healthy habit that stops all bad habits.
C. A healthy habit that triggers a cascade of other healthy habits.
 It’s:    C. A healthy habit that triggers a cascade of other healthy habits.    It’s like buy one, get two—or 10—free. (We love a good sale.)      
 2. True or false: Eating breakfast causes you to lose weight.      
NEXT
A. True
B. False
 It’s:    B. False      .    Eating breakfast isn’t a magic pill for weight loss, and it doesn’t cause you to lose weight. But eating breakfast is a great keystone habit that will help trigger other healthy habits, like eating regularly and making healthier food choices. Ultimately, all these habits can help you stick to your calorie range and reach your weight-loss goals.   
 3. Which of the following is false? Eating regularly…       
NEXT
A. Helps you control your elephant.
B. Controls your blood sugar.
C. Requires you eat six small meals per day.
D. Decreases your hunger by regulating your hunger hormones.
 It’s:    C. Requires you eat six small meals per day.    However, it is true that eating regularly helps you control your elephant, controls your blood sugar, and decreases your hunger by regulating your hunger hormones.   
 4. On Noom’s Satiety Scale (1 to 7), you want to stay between:      
NEXT
A. 1 (remarkably ravenous) to 3 (nothing but neutral).
B. 3 (nothing but neutral) to 5 (fueled and fulfilled).
C. 5 (fueled and fulfilled) to 7 (too full to function).
D. 1 (saying yes to spinach) to 7 (saying no to pants).
 It’s:    B. 3 (nothing but neutral) to 5 (fueled and fulfilled).    This is the best range to help you feel satisfied and keep within your calorie range.   
 5. Every keystone habit we’ve chosen is supported by:      
NEXT
A. Psychology, sociology, and research.
B. Physiology, sociology, and serendipity.
C. Psychic-ology, sociobiology, and seismology.
D. Pseudoscience, swordplay, and serpentology. 
 It’s:    A. Psychology, sociology, and research.    We tap into the latest theories from these three fields to help you develop keystone habits that will make it easier to stay healthy for life. (We also dabble in serpentology, because hobbies are important.)

Keystone habit #3: Control your portions

I'LL TRY
 So far, you’ve learned the importance of:      <ol><li>Befriending breakfast.</li><li>Eating regularly.</li></ol> Now we’re going to focus on controlling your portions. We know, this one’s a little less fun. But stick with us, okay?   


NEXT
   Keystone habit #3: Control your portions       You already know controlling your portions is important, but do you know    how    to control them?           If not, don’t worry. We’ve got Psych Tricks to help with that. (We always do.)          


NEXT
Psych Trick #1: Put it on a plate    If you pick at pretzels in the car, break room, or pantry all day long, your stomach and your mind drift apart. We don’t want that. You don’t want that. (Your inner elephant definitely wants that.)       Putting your food on a plate helps your stomach and your mind register that you are eating—and how much. It also creates pretzel dust, but what can you do?   


NEXT
Psych Trick #2: Make that plate a side plate    Yes, plates are good. But what about those salad plates you’ve never used?        Turns out putting your food on a smaller, side plate can work in two fascinating ways:   <ol><li>It reduces the amount of food you put on your plate—even if your plate is full. </li><li>You might think you’re eating more than you actually are—so you end up eating fewer calories.</li></ol> Thousands of Noomers love the side plate Psych Trick. (Say that three times fast.) Still, everyone is different. Give it a few tries and see what you think.          


NEXT
Psych Trick #3: Use the color system    We wanted to make portion control easy. That’s why our color system has portion recommendations built right in.   <ul><li>Green: Eat lots in small bowls, on small plates, in cups, etc.</li><li>Yellow foods: Eat moderate amounts in partial cups, fistfuls, handfuls, etc.</li><li>Orange foods: Eat small quantities in tablespoons, teaspoons, thumbs, etc.</li></ul> Remember: Green doesn’t mean “good” and orange doesn’t mean “bad.” There are lots of healthy orange foods—like natural peanut butter and olive oil. They’re just healthy in smaller portions.          Using the color system will help you take the guesswork out of portioning out different foods. Then, you can save your mental energy for making the healthiest choices instead.    (Like choosing grapes over raisins, for example.)   


NEXT
Psych Trick #4: Measure your food    Turns out the best way to estimate what you’re eating is to not estimate at all.       You read that correctly—using food scales, measuring cups, and measuring spoons isn't something you need to do forever. (Seriously, there’s no need to bring a teaspoon to your wedding.)       But measuring is a good training tool to help you learn proper portions. With practice, you’ll learn to eyeball portions when you're out at restaurants, parties—and even those “voluntary” corporate softball games.   


DONE
 Guessing how many cups of pasta or tablespoons of pesto you’re eating leads to decision fatigue. (And when you’re exhausted, you’ll probably eat the whole dish. And spare no expense with the Parmesan.)        Besides, most people have    a lot    of trouble estimating calories. Remember, studies show people underestimate their calorie intake by about 600 calories every day.          So, learn to control your portions, and save the tough decisions for deciding what to put on your plate. Any leftover brainpower can be used to keep your elephant in check.      
DONE
Fight portion distortion

SHOW ME
 Not only do we have trouble estimating how much we’re eating, but we’re also not great at knowing how much we    should    be eating.                    Why? Many reasons: diet culture, food labeling, restaurant servings… The list goes on.            Plus, food has changed a lot since the turn of the century. Ready to find out how?   
 In the 1990s, the average restaurant pasta dish was 500 calories (1 cup of spaghetti and sauce with 3 small meatballs). Today, the average restaurant pasta dish is:      
NEXT
A. 600 calories (1 cup of spaghetti and sauce with 3 large meatballs).
B. 800 calories (1 1/2 cups of spaghetti and sauce with 3 large meatballs).
C. 1,000 calories (2 cups of spaghetti and sauce with 3 large meatballs).
D. No idea. I’m really more of a pho person.
 It’s:    C. 1,000 calories (2 cups of spaghetti and sauce with 3 large meatballs).    Today’s pasta dishes are    twice    the size they were in the ’90s. (Like K-pop and roller coasters, they just got bigger.)   
 Back in the ’90s, the average stir-fry was 2 cups and 435 calories. Today, the average stir-fry is:      
NEXT
A. 3 cups and 640 calories.
B. 4 1/2 cups and 865 calories.
C. 6 cups and 1,280 calories.
D. Still full of those adorable baby corn.
 It’s:    B. 4 1/2 cups and 865 calories.    That’s almost double the calories. (And twice the baby corn.)      


SHOW ME
 Since restaurant portions are so big, it’s probably safer to just shop at the store, right?      Well, it’s not just restaurants.    Products in the grocery store have grown, too.    
 Back when grunge was all the rage, a bagel was 3 inches in diameter and 140 calories. Today, the average bagel is:      
NEXT
A. 6 inches and 210 calories.
B. 6 inches and 280 calories.
C. 6 inches and 350 calories.
D. 18 inches and extra olives—oh, wait, that’s our pizza order.
 It’s:    C. 6 inches and 350 calories.    Bagels have doubled in size and more than doubled in calories since the ’90s.      
 Oh, and the dinnerware we’re serving our food on? It’s grown, too.       How has the average dinner plate changed over time?   
NEXT
A. 5 inches (1950) → 7 inches (1980) → 9 inches (now)
B. 7 inches (1950) → 9 inches (1980) → 11 inches (now)
C. 9 inches (1950) → 11 inches (1980) → 12 inches (now)
 It’s:    C. 9 inches (1950) → 11 inches (1980) → 12 inches (now)      .    And remember: The bigger the plate, the more you might end up eating. (And the more dish soap you’ll need.)   


HOW?
 We know what you’re thinking:    Wait, no more bagels? Tiny plates? So I just have to eat Swiss chard on a child-size dish for the rest of my life?           Nope. Noom can help you navigate restaurant dining, bagel buying, and eating on all sizes of plates.       Want to know how?          


NEXT
    It’s simple: by logging.         Logging your food helps you put    serving size    and    calories    together.


NEXT
 Let’s look at an example.           If you go to log a grilled steak with the rest of your dinner, you’ll see the following:           <embed alt="day17-task3-8B.png" embedtype="image" format="left" id="4428"/>              If you’re eating it with a small sweet potato (about 100 calories) and a cup of steamed broccoli (about 55 calories), you’ll probably want to opt for a steak that is 3 to 5 ounces (142 to 237 calories—and a great serving size for protein), to create a meal that’s around 300 to 400 calories.      


NEXT
 Now imagine you’re out to dinner at a restaurant. While you could order steamed mussels, you came here to enjoy a delicious steak. (Good for you.)           They bring your dish served with a baked potato and steamed veggies. You notice the plate looks suspiciously large. So you check Noom’s food database:           <embed alt="day17-task3-8C.png" embedtype="image" format="left" id="4429"/>                  Wow. Your steak is 890 calories—and that doesn’t even count what’s in the breadbasket.           You now know that this restaurant’s portions are double the recommended serving sizes—and that you can adjust how you eat accordingly.        


DONE
 You’ve done lots of food logging since you started this program. Think: What have you learned by logging?                 Caloric density? Recommended portions? Foods that you didn't know were totally breaking your calorie bank?   
DONE
Patricia took control of her diet

WHAT WAS IT?
 Patricia had tried everything to shed weight. But every weight-loss program wanted her to eat in points or pre-portioned meals—which worked great… until she had to step into the real world. (You know, the one with potlucks, coffee breaks, and food courts.)                    All this gave Patricia a bad case of portion distortion:    She had never learned what to eat or how much.              And then she had a realization.   


NEXT
 She noticed that her previous dieting extremes were simply not sustainable. In order to keep the weight off, Patricia needed to learn new habits and actively participate in them. And she needed to figure out portioning for herself, rather than eating pre-packaged foods or following a confusing system.      “I love Noom’s philosophy. No foods are off limits. I’m learning how to make better choices. There’s no need to see a nutritionist every few weeks, go to meetings, or look to the internet for advice.    This time, I’m in control.   ”


NEXT
 To take charge of her own portioning system, Patricia started logging her food.       “The color system gives me the flexibility to find foods that satisfy me, in the proper portions. The flexibility is so valuable and keeps me on track! I don’t have any wild cravings, and I’m never left feeling super hungry.”       In other words,    she learned to manage her elephant.          Now she knows which foods to pack on her plate (green foods like spinach, berries, and nonfat yogurt), which foods to eat in moderate portions (yellow ones like chicken breast and black beans), and which foods to eat in smaller portions (orange ones like almonds and olive oil).          


DONE
 Patricia focused on making healthy food choices and keeping her portions in check—and her hard work paid off. Just 16 weeks into the course, Patricia has already lost 22 pounds.              <embed alt="day17-task4-1.png" embedtype="image" format="left" id="4417"/>          Not only does she feel better, but her health has improved dramatically and her high blood pressure has returned to within a healthy range.           Proud of you, Patricia.

The time it takes to build a habit

SOUNDS FAMILIAR
 Let’s review what we know about habits, shall we?                    You know    the behavior chain is what makes or breaks a habit      .    That… and practice. Lots and lots of practice.                 Question: Do you know how long it takes to build or dump a habit?           Maybe you heard it takes 21 days.   


NEXT
 Turns out this whole three-weeks-to-a-new-habit thing is a myth. It could take 21 days to make a behavior a habit, but it could also take 14, 35, or 67 days.       How long it takes to launch a habit depends on three things:   <ol><li>   Frequency   : Is it an hourly habit? Daily? Monthly? An hourly habit may take less time to develop. If it’s a monthly thing, it definitely can’t take any less than two months. (Doing something once does not a habit make. Just ask our vacuum.) </li><li>   Effort   : The more effort you put into planning, preparing, and pursuing this new habit, the sooner you’ll get there.</li><li>   Distance   : Where are you now? Where do you want to be? The shorter the distance between your current habit and your new habit, the less time it will take to adopt that new habit. </li></ol> Makes sense, right?

 One Noomer, Pam, said it best: “You’ve created a habit when it’s no longer what you do, it’s who you are.”       (Hat tip to psychology. And also to Pam.)

Keystone habit #4: Unprocess your diet

TELL ME MORE
 So far, we’ve talked about when, how often, and how much you should eat.              Now it’s time to talk about processed foods—the sweets, cereals, salad dressings, and more we find in the center aisles of our grocery stores.   


NEXT
    As you know, we are big on moderation—not deprivation.           And while no foods are off-limits, a slice of cheesecake or chicken tikka masala at your favorite restaurant should be the exception, not the rule.       The majority of your diet should be made up of nutritious, whole foods that make your belly full (think: low caloric density) and your body happy (think: energy and, well, regularity).          


WELP
 But processed, packaged foods have taken over our diets—and they’re making it harder for us to eat whole, nutritious foods.       In fact, the    British Medical Journal    found that    almost 60% of calories consumed by the average American come from processed foods.                        <embed alt="day18-task1-3B.png" embedtype="image" format="left" id="4469"/>                


NEXT
 The main problem with all this pre-packaged food? Processing often strips foods of things your body needs, like fiber and vitamins, and adds things your body is prone to crave, like salt and sugar.           Bummer, we know. (You’re not the only person who loves kids’ cereal.)   


NEXT
Keystone habit #4: Unprocess your diet    Getting rid of processed foods and replacing them with whole foods—like bananas, oatmeal, and pistachios—can help you give your body the fuel it needs to get through the day.      Plus,    unprocessing is a super-important step in retraining your brain.    By slowly cutting back on calorically dense, processed foods, you can change your palate and rewire your brain to prefer    nutritious eats    over    unhealthy treats.    (Which is good news for that giant bag of frozen mango you bought last year.)


NEXT
1. Processed foods make you hungrier    This problem is twofold:   
    Processed carbohydrates, for example, are stripped of fiber and high in refined sugar.    This means they’re quickly broken down, causing huge spikes in your blood sugar.          The quicker the spike, the quicker the crash.    When you crash, you need food    right now.          Ever feel hungry less than an hour after devouring a donut? (We sure do.)          
Problem 1: They make you crash
 There’s no sugarcoating it: Processed foods are delicious.    When food tastes good, it’s a lot easier to tune out your fullness cues      .    Have you ever felt full after just a few bites…but then still polished off that churro anyway? Yep, you got your cues skewed.        Chances are you haven’t felt sick after overindulging in cucumbers. Your body told you it was satisfied and you listened.   
Problem 2: They skew your cues


DARN
2. Processed foods are rewarding    Processed foods increase your appetite…for more processed foods.          Eating (or even seeing) foods that are high in salt, sugar, and fat—usually processed foods—wakes up the part of the brain associated with rewards, pleasure, and cravings.          Rewards encourage behaviors—they’re a form of positive reinforcement. When repeated over time, behaviors become habits. (This all sounds familiar, right?)       So once you get into a rhythm of eating processed food, it’ll start to become a habit—and then you’ll eat even more processed food. It’s a vicious (albeit tasty) cycle.          


NEXT
3. Processed foods are addictive    While food addiction isn’t an official diagnosis just yet, it’s a concept that’s gaining lots of traction among psychologists and other researchers.       How come?          There’s growing evidence that food (particularly processed food) produces addictive-like patterns and behaviors    such as:   <ul><li>Unsuccessful attempts to quit (that soda habit you just can’t seem to shake).</li><li>Increased tolerance over time (you need more than one scoop of gelato to feel satisfied).</li><li>Symptoms of withdrawal (when you forgo popcorn at the theater, you feel antsy).</li><li>A preoccupation with getting these foods (you’ll do anything to get those empanadas—even in the middle of the night).</li></ul>


DONE
 Step one in the unprocessing process is self-awareness—that Psych Trick where you analyze your thoughts, feelings, motivations, and desires.       To start, identify three problematic processed foods in your diet. These might be foods that:   <ul><li>You just can’t shake. (Looking at you, marshmallows.)</li><li>Make you forget about moderation.</li><li>Leave you wanting more.</li><li>Increase your appetite.</li><li>Make you feel a little too happy. (Good thing Gouda’s not ultra-processed.)</li><li>Cause you to feel downright awful—physically, mentally, emotionally.</li></ul> How are you managing these problematic foods while using Noom? (Substitution? Moderation? Avoiding them completely?) Your answers will be the starting point to share tips and tricks—and begin the (un)process.

 It’s:    B. A 6-inch tuna melt sandwich      .    Most tuna melts contain upwards of 1,000 milligrams (nearly 3/4 teaspoon) of sodium. Although the entire bag of salt-and-vinegar chips is a close second (900 milligrams).   
Scrap the salt

WHAT IS IT?
 If you guessed the tuna melt, we’re impressed. Most people wouldn’t have guessed that.       That's the thing with sodium. It’s both…       <ol><li>    Everywhere.    Seriously, even celery contains sodium!         And…         </li><li>    Sneaky.    Food doesn't have to taste “salty” to be high in salt. (Like your humble sandwich.)   </li></ol>    But we’ve found a trend…          


NEXT
 More than 40% of the salt we consume every day comes from just 10 different foods.       These 10 foods include savory snacks like chips and crackers, pizza, cold cuts, cured meats, soup, and breads and rolls. Even our beloved cheese makes the list. (Please keep us in your thoughts during this difficult time.)   


NEXT
 So, why do restaurants, snack manufacturers, and cheesemongers (that’s a fun word to say) use so much salt? Simple: for flavor.      Salt is what we like to call a flavor changer. That’s why your meal might be packing tons of salt even if you don’t taste it. Salt isn’t just for salting; it’s used to enhance, suppress, or change    other    flavors, too.
    <ul><li>Salt suppresses bitter taste. Seriously, try adding it to your morning coffee. </li><li>Salt balances out sweet and sour flavors. (Think about your movie-night trifecta: popcorn, chocolate, and sour gummies.)</li></ul>    
More salt in your snack wounds


NEXT
 Another reason why packaged foods use so much salt? Shelf life.       Salt is also a preservative—it keeps food “fresh” longer.        That’s why that (very salty) can of chili in your pantry doesn’t expire until long after your lease is up.   


NEXT
 Why do we care about eating too much salt? Lots of reasons. Salt…    <ul><li>   Skews your taste buds   : Salt feeds salt cravings. Salt also feeds salt oblivion, so you don’t realize how salty foods are. When you do start to reduce the salt in your diet, you’ll find yourself becoming increasingly sensitive to salt.</li><li>   Makes you feel bloated   : Sodium causes you to retain water, so a salty meal might make you look and feel extra “full.”</li><li>   Causes weight fluctuations   : Although you aren’t truly gaining weight, salt can change your water weight, leaving you confused and frustrated.</li><li>   Increases your blood pressure:    If you’re salt-sensitive, which most people are.</li></ul>


DONE
 Before we wrap up, we want to clarify something:    Salt is not the enemy.             Salt is essential      .    We won’t go into the nitty-gritty, but salt helps shuttle important nutrients into all of the cells in your body. We don’t want to disturb that.       So, in short: Eat a little salt—and read those labels.

Learn to spot added sugar

ONLY KIND OF
     It’s time to talk about added sugar. (We know, we know, we love it, too.)              Ready to get started?   
 First, let’s nail down some sugar truths…       What is added sugar?   
NEXT
A. Sugar that costs extra (like guacamole.)
B. Any sugar that is added when food is prepared or processed.
C. Any and all sugar.
 It’s:    B. Any sugar that is added when food is prepared or processed      .    This can be sugar you put in your coffee, or sugar found in highly processed foods like sodas or baked goods.    
 What is the max amount of added sugar you should have in your diet?   
NEXT
A. Less than 5% of your daily calories (25 grams).
B. 6 teaspoons for women (25 grams), 9 teaspoons for men (38 grams).
C. Less than 10% of your daily calories (50 grams).
D. All of the above.
E. None of the above.
 It’s:    D. All of the above      .    Health experts agree that    we should limit our added sugar   , although there’s not one clear recommendation. Most organizations suggest we stick to no more than 6 to 12 teaspoons daily.    
 How much added sugar in the average diet comes from highly processed foods?      
NEXT
A. About 15%.
B. About 50%.
C. About 70%.
D. About 90%.
 It’s:    D. About 90%      .    Wow, right? Nearly all of the added sugars in our diets come from ultra-processed foods. You’re not getting most of the sugar in your diet from that one packet of sugar in your morning coffee.   
 Which are the biggest sources of added sugar in the average diet?      
NEXT
A. Sugar-sweetened beverages (like soda, juice, and energy drinks).
B. Sweets and snacks (like cakes, pastries, pies, and more).
 It’s:    A. Sugar-sweetened beverages (like soda, juice, and energy drinks)      .    Sugary drinks account for 47% of added sugar.      


GOT IT
 So far you’ve learned that added sugar is everywhere, especially in drinks and processed foods. And while these are big sources of added sugar, there    are    other major, lesser-known sources, including:   <ul><li>Breakfast cereals and granolas.</li><li>Bars like granola bars or protein bars.</li><li>Canned fruit (packed in juice or syrup).</li><li>Condiments, marinades, and spreads like ketchup, teriyaki sauce, and chutney.</li><li>Dried fruits—some have added sugar, so be sure to check.</li><li>Flavored milk and milk products like flavored yogurts.</li><li>Pasta sauces like tomato sauce or Alfredo sauce.</li><li>Premade soups.</li><li>Nut butters—read the labels.</li><li>Salad dressings like French, Caesar, or sesame. </li><li>Shakes, smoothies, and juice—yes, they make these    even    sweeter.</li><li>Specialty drinks like flavored lattes and frappés.</li></ul>


NOT SO SWEET
 Now, let’s get out our proverbial sugar binoculars, and talk about how to spot added sugars on labels and ingredient lists.        When people think of sugar, they often think of brown sugar, powdered sugar, raw sugar, and granulated sugar. But added sugar comes in lots of deceptive shapes and sizes. There are so many types of added sugar in our diets, it's pretty overwhelming.       When you’re reading a nutrition facts label, added sugar won’t always be listed as “sugar.” Make sure to look for these synonyms, too.   <ul><li>Corn syrup.</li><li>Dextrose.</li><li>Honey.</li><li>Fructose.</li><li>High-fructose corn syrup.</li><li>Lactose.</li><li>Malt syrup (milkshake, anyone?) </li><li>Maltose.</li><li>Maple syrup.</li><li>Molasses.</li><li>Nectars.</li><li>Sucrose.</li></ul>


DONE
 The only foolproof way to steer clear of added sugar is to unprocess your diet. And remember: Added sugar is    any sugar    that’s added to food when it’s prepared.       We know that, for most people, cutting out all processed foods isn’t realistic. (Or fun. You’re here for a good time    and    a long time.) You’re going to keep eating marinara sauce, yogurt, and sweet chili sauce.        The best advice we’ve got? Eat more whole foods when you can—and try to be mindful of how much added sugar is in whatever you’re enjoying today.

Fight the wrong fats

COFFEE
 You’ve already learned that salt is not the enemy. (Although too much is.)                    Now repeat after us: Fat is    not    the enemy, either.                 Seriously, say it with us now, three times.                 “Fat is not the enemy.”     “Fat is not the enemy.”    “Fat is not the enemy.”                 If you actually said that out loud three times, hat tip to you.       Because it’s true:    Fat is essential to your diet, and your body needs fat to function at its best      .    (And coffee. Lots and lots of coffee.)      


NEXT
 But before you reach for that half-and-half, let’s talk a little bit about the different types of fats. There are tons of healthy sources of fat, including…    <ul><li>Avocado—we’ll put a slice on literally anything.</li><li>Fatty fish like salmon, mackerel, and sardines.</li><li>Whole eggs.</li><li>Nuts like almonds, cashews, pistachios, and walnuts.</li><li>Seeds like chia seeds, flaxseeds, hemp seeds, pumpkin seeds, and sunflower seeds.</li><li>Olives. (Don’t mind if we do.)</li><li>Oils like olive oil and avocado oil.</li></ul> Notice a trend?          Healthy fats are found in minimally processed or unprocessed foods.             


NEXT
 But as you might have guessed, most fat in the average American diet comes from processed foods. And that means people are mostly eating unhealthy fats—not the ones found in whole, nutrient-rich foods.       Here are some of the biggest culprits:   <ul><li>Desserts and baked goods.</li><li>Sausages, hot dogs, bacon, and ribs (sounds like a barbecue, right?)</li><li>Ice cream and dairy desserts.</li><li>French fries.</li><li>Fried chicken.</li></ul>


YIKES
 There are three ways food processing messes with fat:   
 Buzzwords like “fat-free,” “low-fat,” and “0%” are usually just marketing: an attempt to confuse you into thinking a product is healthy or wholesome based on fat content alone.        Removing fat tends to make food less, well, delicious. And unfortunately, when you remove something, you’ve got to replace it somehow.    So when manufacturers take fat out of food, they usually pump it up with sugar and additives like pectins, gums, and carrageenans.    The sugar helps the altered food stay tasty, and the additives keep it thick and creamy. (Well,    kind    of tasty, and    kind    of creamy.)       Just check the (extensive) ingredients and nutrition labels of fat-free ranch dressing or reduced-fat peanut butter. (The proof is also in the pudding. Literally.)          
Fats are removed
    Fats make food taste good   —they have a special quality that most scientists attribute to their smooth, satisfying mouthfeel. (Think cream cheese frosting on a birthday cake.) So food manufacturers add vegetable oil, butter, margarine, shortening, lard, and more to foods to make them more palatable.    
Fats are added
 Most food manufacturers have one thing in mind: profits.        If you need evidence, think about the rise and fall of trans fats. Back in the early 1900s, food scientists played around by heating vegetable oil with hydrogen atoms and a catalyst. (We hope they had lab goggles.)       In this process, they created (very cheap, shelf-stable) partially hydrogenated vegetable oils, shortenings, and margarines. These new fats could be sold on their own or mixed into packaged goods like cookies, crackers, and muffins.          Today, trans fats are literally    against       the law   .    The Food and Drug Administration banned artificial trans fats after linking them to heart attacks, strokes, and type 2 diabetes. They’ve been removed from all foods since 2018.       Pretty wild, we know. But by choosing whole, unprocessed fats like avocado and walnuts, you won’t have to worry so much about turning your afternoon snack into a chemistry experiment.            
Fats are changed


NEXT
 We’ve talked about how low-fat, processed foods typically contain lots of refined carbohydrates, sugar, and additives—and that they aren’t nutritious, either.        And how many less-processed, high-fat foods have a ton of healthy nutrients like vitamins and minerals—and that they can also be high in protein and fiber.          Because fats are calorie dense and will be a small part of your calorie budget, it’s important to make sure you’re picking the fats that will give you other essential nutrients your body needs, too.          Long story short: Choose your fats wisely. Make that chicken, egg, or tuna salad with half a mashed avocado instead of 2 tablespoons of processed mayo.          
 <embed alt="day18-task4-5B.png" embedtype="image" format="left" id="4441"/>              Avocados contain healthier fat—and less of it—plus lots of fiber and many essential vitamins and minerals. (Three cheers for avocados.)      
Show me why


DONE
 To cut back on unnecessary calories and fat:          1. Nix the fried foods.    2. Cook with half the oil.       3. Opt for lower-fat dairy products—and watch for added sugar.      
 4. Buy leaner cuts of meat and poultry, like chicken breasts over chicken thighs.       5. Trim the fat from meat and poultry before cooking.       6. Replace some or all of the oil in baked goods with unsweetened applesauce, banana, or other pureed fruit. (Good way to use up all that canned pumpkin from last fall, no?)       7. Replace cream-based soups and sauces with veggie-based alternatives.

 Here are some tips to get more bang for your (calorie) buck:          1. Sprinkle 1/4 cup mixed seeds (like chia and sunflower) on your yogurt instead of granola.    2. Take hard-boiled eggs to-go in the morning, instead of buying a pastry or muffin.       3. Top your salad with 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar instead of 2 tablespoons store-bought dressing.      
    4. Crunch on 1/4 cup raw nuts and seeds instead of 10 crackers.    5. Roast potatoes in 1 tablespoon olive oil and seasonings instead of heating up frozen fries.       6. Substitute fatty fish for fatty cuts of beef.       7. Top your baked potato (or your burrito) with plain, unsweetened Greek yogurt instead of sour cream.       8. Enjoy four squares of extra-dark chocolate instead of 1/2 cup ice cream.

LET'S GO
 Four keystone habits down, three to go!                    You’re more than halfway to understanding how seven keystone habits can help you make sustainable changes to your diet and develop a healthier relationship with food.                  You’ve said “good morning” to breakfast, learned about eating regularly, read all about portion control, and even started to unprocess your diet. (And maybe even tried a sardine. Hey, they’re full of healthy fats!)                 You’re doing great. And now is    not    the time to slow down.            So, without further ado, let’s get back to achieving Your Big Picture. Ready?   
LET'S GO
Mind, meet body

I'M LISTENING
    Picture this:           It’s 3 p.m. on a Sunday afternoon. You’ve put off all of your errands for the upcoming week. You’re rushing around to get to the grocery store, the pharmacy, and the mechanic…all before closing time.          I’ve got too much on my plate.          I shouldn’t have waited until today to do all this stuff.           Nobody ever helps me with errands.          There’s not enough coffee in my body to do half the things on this list.           Your mind is experiencing stress. Your body is, too. Maybe you’re starting to get a headache, or maybe you have a pit in your stomach.       And while you might be aware of your stressful thoughts and sensations, there’s also a lot going on inside your body that you’re not aware of.


NEXT
    Believe it or not, thoughts trigger the release of chemicals in your body   —a neurotransmitter, a hormone, or another signal.       In this example, stress triggers a whole cascade of bodily signals. Studies published in journals like    Biological Psychology    tell us that:   <ul><li>Your adrenaline (a hormone that's associated with the fight-or-flight response) skyrockets. </li><li>Your cortisol (the stress hormone that messes with    everything   ) shoots through the roof. </li></ul> These messengers tell your body “I’m stressed!” or “I need to run from a bear!” (The bear, of course, is a metaphor. At least we hope so.)                           Psychologists call this interplay the mind-body connection.         


NEXT
 While the “mind-body connection” sounds like an expensive yoga class, it’s actually straight-up science.        Study after study shows the countless physical effects of psychological stress:    <ul><li>Increased risk of diabetes and heart disease.</li><li>Weakened immune system.</li><li>High blood sugar.</li><li>Increased heart rate and blood pressure.</li><li>Physical pain or muscle tension.</li><li>Fatigue or difficulty sleeping.</li><li>Upset stomach.</li><li>And more…</li></ul> We’re not saying this to scare you. After all, we can’t frighten your stress away.        We’re saying this because you deserve the facts, even if they’re not always the easiest to swallow.   


NEXT
 So, what does all this stress stuff mean for you?       Well, for starters,    you can eat all the kale in the world, but if you’re not taking care of your mind, you’re never going to feel your best.    (Although we’re not sure eating all that kale will make you feel that great, anyway.)       Same for positive thinking. You can shout affirmation after affirmation, but if you’re neglecting to give yourself a break or take a breath of fresh air, you aren’t going to feel great.          The mind-body connection is real.      


LET'S GO
 We’ll leave you with this:    Your mind-body connection is one of the most important connections you’ll have in your life   … and the longest relationship you’ll ever have.           Maybe your mind-body connection isn’t where you want it to be yet. That’s okay. We’ve got plenty of time to work on that—starting now. And in your next lesson, of course.   
LET'S GO
Let’s get quizzical

QUIZ ME
 Remember consolidation, that neat Psych Trick where we convert short-term memory into long-term memory?                    It’s that time again. Time to take a short quiz. But keep in mind, there's no pressure, because this kind of quiz is all about helping you learn.           Are you ready to get quizzical?   
 1. True or false: It takes 21 days to make or break a habit.      
NEXT
A. True—also the same amount of time it took that weird pear to ripen. Sheesh.
B. False
 It’s:    B. False      .    How long it takes to make or break a habit depends on the frequency of the habit, the effort you put into it, and the margin between where you are and where you want to be. It could take longer, it could take shorter, but don’t get discouraged—it’s about the journey toward the goal. (As for that pear, try sticking it in a paper bag with a banana.)      
 2. Which of the following is    not    a Psych Trick for portion control?      
NEXT
A. Putting it on a plate
B. Making it a side plate (Ooh, more plates.)
C. Avoiding high-fat foods
D. Measuring your food
 It’s:    C. Avoiding high-fat foods    is    not    a Psych Trick for portion control. There are tons of healthy, high-fat foods that shouldn’t be avoided—like darling avocados. So use Psych Tricks like putting it on a (side) plate, food measuring, and the Noom color system to keep your portions in check.   
 3. Why do processed foods make you hungrier?      
NEXT
A. They cause quick spikes and crashes in your blood sugar.
B. They play with your hunger and fullness cues.
C. Because the packaging is so noisy.
D. A and B.
E. None of the above.
 It’s:    D. A and B      .    Processed foods make you hungrier by making your blood glucose levels spike and drop quickly. Plus, they mess with your true hunger and fullness cues. Whenever possible, choose whole foods over processed foods. (And try to open that bag of salt-and-vinegar chips quietly.)      
 4. Why is salt found in so many restaurants and packaged foods?      
NEXT
A. It enhances flavor and increases shelf life.
B. It can help reduce bloat.
C. It helps lower blood pressure.
D. All of the above.
E. None of the above.
 It’s:    A. It enhances flavor and increases shelf life.    Salt is a flavor enhancer and preservative, helping foods taste better and last longer. But remember: You don’t want to eat more than 1 teaspoon of salt a day, so be on the lookout. (And, yes, salt actually increases bloat and raises blood pressure.)      
 5. Which of the following is a source of added sugar?      
NEXT
A. Breakfast cereals—which can also be a source of bottom-of-the-box prizes.
B. Salad dressing
C. Dried fruit
D. Pasta sauce
E. All of the above
F. None of the above
 It’s:    E. All of the above      .    Cereals, salad dressing, dried fruit, and sauces can be—and typically are—sneaky sources of added sugar. Make sure to read the labels!

Keystone habit #5: Lose the labels

MAYBE
 What are the first three words that come to mind when you think of a chocolate chip cookie?              Bad? Comforting? Indulgent? Junk? Unhealthy?           Did any of these—or similar words—come to mind?   


NEXT
 If so, you’re not alone. These are some of the most common adjectives Noomers use to describe a chocolate chip cookie when they’re first starting out.           Why? It’s the very same reason some people love (read: become absolutely obsessed with) label-making machines: because humans have a tendency to categorize thoughts into buckets.   


TELL ME MORE
    This tendency to categorize thoughts is totally normal.    In psychology, it’s called    compartmentalization   .       According to the American Psychological Association,    compartmentalization    happens when people separate conflicting thoughts and feelings, placing them into different compartments, like good or bad. (Or sweet and spicy.)        Compartmentalization can be helpful—and it’s also great for sorting laundry… but when it comes to weight loss, our need to compartmentalize can be damaging.           


NEXT
Keystone habit #5: Lose the labels       When you mentally label a food as “bad,” “unhealthy,” or “junk,” you’re basically wrapping it in caution tape and putting a big off-limits stamp on it.          You might think that food labeling will help you stay on track and reach your goals. Perhaps you figure that by cutting out pizza, you’ll hike the Grand Canyon sooner. Or YBP will come true in 6 months, instead of 10.       In the short term, this type of thinking might help you, but long-term, it will backfire. (Trust us.)          


NEXT
 It’s what we call the label loop—and it’s essentially a type of behavior chain. (Yes, another one of those.)           Let’s break it down, shall we?             


NEXT
    Our need to compartmentalize causes us to label things. In the context of food, this might look like:   <ul><li>Good versus bad</li><li>Healthy versus unhealthy</li><li>Guilty versus guilt-free</li><li>Light versus fattening</li></ul> Maybe, for example, you categorize those chocolate chip cookies as naughty.           But from a psychological—and weight-loss—perspective, this kind of food labeling is more harmful than helpful. (Labeling is for cabinets, jars, drawers, and storage bins...not cookies.)      
1. You label a food as “bad”
 You walk into a fancy baby shower and spot the buffet table. There’s just about every kind of cookie imaginable. They’re exactly what you’ve deemed “bad.” This is your environmental trigger.        When you see this “bad” food, the trigger produces a series of thoughts…   
2. Trigger: You see the “bad” food
    This is junk.          I can’t eat this.          This food will sabotage my progress.          When we label foods as off-limits, we feel    physiologically deprived.          Experts believe that when you restrict your food intake too much, your body starts craving calorie-dense foods. Probably the very same foods you were trying to avoid. Maybe you don't want just one cookie anymore, you want them all, and to make them ice cream sandwiches. (Dipped in chocolate.)      Plus, when we feel    psychologically deprived    by food restriction…
3. Thought: I can’t have it


NEXT
 One interesting study states that    caloric restriction makes foods seem rewarding, which can cause us to eat more, higher-calorie foods.          In fact, simply seeing images of these foods activates your brain’s reward center, and eating—or just sensing—these foods causes the feel-good hormone dopamine to be released. (Hello, positive reinforcement. And hello, chocolate chip cookies.)          On the other hand, when you’re feeling satisfied and not depriving yourself, low-calorie foods can feel more rewarding.           Food restriction can make less-nutritious foods feel more rewarding, so…   
4. Food becomes more rewarding
 Ultimately, most people eventually give in to their no-nos.        Not only do they give in, but they tend to lose control. No matter how much you label those cookies, you’re almost certain to eat one—or nine—eventually.       This is a recipe for disaster…and the perfect setup for a restrict-binge cycle.   
5. You end up eating the “forbidden” food
 When you finally get a taste of foods that you’ve decided are off-limits, you might feel angry, upset, guilty, and ashamed. (Oh, and full of way-too-sugary party cookies.)       These emotions create an even more difficult relationship with these foods and lead to yet more food labeling.   
6. You feel terrible


LET'S DO IT
 The label loop is tough.                 But there’s hope. You can break it.                 And we’ll help you do it.           Your next task is to identify your label loop and overcome all-or-nothing thinking. Are you ready to break the cycle and start feeling some freedom around food again? (And enjoy one delicious cookie, and then get on with your day?)

In the short term (think: weight loss success), this type of thinking might help you, but long-term, it will backfire (think: weight regain).          


NEXT
 It’s what we call the label loop—and it’s essentially a type of behavior chain (yes, another one of those) that's especially common for people who have tried losing weight before.       Let’s break it down, shall we?   


NEXT
 Our need to compartmentalize causes us to label things. In the context of food, this might look like:   <ul><li>Good versus bad</li><li>Healthy versus unhealthy</li><li>Guilty versus guilt-free</li><li>Light versus fattening</li></ul> Maybe, for example, you categorize those chocolate chip cookies as naughty.           But from a psychological—and weight-loss—perspective, this kind of food labeling is more harmful than helpful. (Labeling is for cabinets, jars, drawers, and storage bins...not cookies.)      
1. You label a food as “bad”
 You walk into a fancy baby shower and spot the buffet table. There’s just about every kind of cookie imaginable. They’re exactly what you’ve deemed “bad.” This is your environmental trigger.        When you see this “bad” food, the trigger produces a series of thoughts…   
2. Trigger: You see the “bad” food
    This is junk.          I can’t eat this.          This food will sabotage my progress.          When we label foods as off-limits, we feel    physiologically deprived.          Experts believe that when you restrict your food intake too much, your body starts craving calorie-dense foods. Probably the very same foods you were trying to avoid. Maybe you don't want just one cookie anymore, you want them all, and to make them ice cream sandwiches. (Dipped in chocolate.)      Plus, when we feel    psychologically deprived    by food restriction…
3. Thought: I can’t have it


NEXT
 One interesting study states that    caloric restriction makes foods seem rewarding, which can cause us to eat more, higher-calorie foods.          In fact, simply seeing images of these foods activates your brain’s reward center, and eating—or just sensing—these foods causes the feel-good hormone dopamine to be released. (Hello, positive reinforcement. And hello, chocolate chip cookies.)          On the other hand, when you’re feeling satisfied and not depriving yourself, low-calorie foods can feel more rewarding.           Food restriction can make less-nutritious foods feel more rewarding, so…   
4. Food becomes more rewarding
 Ultimately, most people eventually give in to their no-nos.        Not only do they give in, but they tend to lose control. No matter how much you label those cookies, you’re almost certain to eat one—or nine—eventually.       This is a recipe for disaster…and the perfect setup for a restrict-binge cycle.   
5. You end up eating the “forbidden” food
    When you finally get a taste of foods that you’ve decided are off-limits, you might feel angry, upset, guilty, and ashamed. (Oh, and full of way-too-sugary party cookies.)       These emotions create an even more difficult relationship with these foods and lead to yet more food labeling.   
6. You feel terrible


LET'S DO IT
 The label loop is tough.                 But there’s hope. You can break it.                 And we’ll help you do it.           Your next task is to identify your label loop and overcome all-or-nothing thinking. Are you ready to break the cycle and start feeling some freedom around food again? (And enjoy one delicious cookie, and then get on with your day?)   
LET'S DO IT
Overcome all-or-nothing thinking

GO ON
     Food labeling—when we mentally label a food as “bad,” “unhealthy,” or “junk”—is a form of all-or-nothing thinking. (Acquiring a label-making machine, on the other hand, is a form of genius, inspired thinking.)      


NEXT
 All-or-nothing (or black-and-white) thinking is a type of thought distortion. You see things as falling into extremes. Either you’re the image of perfection, or you’re a complete and utter failure.       In the context of eating, food is either…   <ul><li>Good or bad.</li><li>Healthy or unhealthy.</li><li>Diet-friendly or diet-destroying.</li><li>Approved or off-limits.</li></ul> Not fun at all, right?          


NEXT
 But as you’ve learned, labeling foods as “good” or “bad” doesn’t work in the long run. (Neither does labeling your lunch in the office fridge, but that’s really more of a problem for HR.)       What if that chocolate chip cookie wasn’t bad? It wasn’t indulgent, or off-limits?       What if that chocolate chip cookie was simply a chocolate chip cookie? That’s it. That’s all.           


YES
 Today, you’re going to use the behavior chain to help you overcome all-or-nothing thinking and break the label loop cycle—that cycle that begins when we label a food and ends when we wind up eating lots of it anyway.      1. Find your food (trigger)    Choose one food that you have a love-hate relationship with and want to finally make peace with. Maybe it’s birthday cake—because your kid’s at the age where you basically spend your whole weekend at parties with clowns.       Did you find your food?          


NEXT
2. List the labels (thought, part 1)    Think of all the words you’ve used to describe this food. And don’t stop with just one or two labels—keep asking “what else?” until you can’t think of any more labels. For example: “cheesy,” “off-limits,” “delightful,” “diet-wrecking,” “taboo,” “disgusting.”       Done?       We bet you’ve got one more label in you.       Okay, now continue.          


NEXT
3. Expose the thoughts (thought, part 2)    What types of thoughts do you have about this food?          I can’t eat that food, ever.          I could never just have a bit of that.          I’ll go out of control if I have that in the house.          I don’t deserve to eat this because I didn’t work out today.          This food will make me gain weight, for sure.          Any others? Exposed them all?          


NEXT
4. Analyze your actions    When your rider is strong, you might successfully avoid this food for a little while.       But because you’re thinking about that cookie so much, you feel deprived, and those tiny, bite-size chocolate chips become even more rewarding. (That’s the label loop again.)       Then your elephant takes over and you give in.       Do you eat the whole tray of cookies instead of just one or two? Do you take a box home and have a late-night storm-eating session? Do you throw your goals (and that Greek salad you prepped for dinner) out the window?       Let’s be honest: It happens. Maybe not our proudest moment, but we are human.       And while we might struggle right now, we’ll eventually break this habit. (Thanks, Psych Tricks.)          


NEXT
5. Call out the consequences    When all’s said and done, after your elephant gets loose, how do you feel?       Guilty? Ashamed? Bloated? Uncomfortable? Worthless? Sluggish? Weak? Complain-y? Searching for antacids?       Call out all the mental, emotional, and physical consequences.   


NEXT
6. Break the cycle    Breaking your label loop—that behavior chain we set off when we label foods—won’t happen today. And it probably won’t happen tomorrow. It will take lots of practice and a few Psych Tricks that you’ve learned along the way.       But what you    can    do now is make a plan to start cutting through these label loops. And commit to it.       Because you can only avoid the trigger for so long. What happens if you’re at a party and someone comes around to offer you a slice of cheesecake? How will avoiding cheesecake help you make peace with it?       It won’t. But it could make you think about cheesecake even more. (Cue the label loop.)       What you want to do is:   <ol><li>   Remove (or change) the food label.   </li><li>   Replace your thought distortions about the food.   </li><li>   Associate the thought with a different behavior   —like enjoying a slice of delicious cheesecake once in a while.</li></ol>


NEXT
Example 1: Shrimp tempura        Remove (or change) the food label:      <ul><li>Shrimp tempura is “off-limits.” → Shrimp tempura is “shrimp tempura.” or “Shrimp tempura is okay in moderation.”</li></ul>    Replace your thoughts about the food:      <ul><li>“I can’t control myself around shrimp tempura.” → “I am always in control of my actions.”</li></ul>    Associate the thought with a different behavior:      <ul><li>Bingeing on shrimp tempura when you’re feeling weak → Planning to enjoy a shrimp or two when it sounds good to you and fits into your calorie budget</li></ul>


GOT IT
Example 2: Cheesecake        Remove or change the food label:      <ul><li>Cheesecake is “diet-destroying” → Cheesecake is “cheesecake” or “Many foods in excess can be diet-destroying.”</li></ul>    Replace your thoughts about the food:      <ul><li>“I can’t eat that.” → “I can eat that in moderation.”</li></ul>    Associate the thought with a different behavior:      <ul><li>Restricting yourself, then overindulging → Planning to treat yourself occasionally</li></ul>


DONE
 Now that you’re feeling inspired, create your    break-the-cycle plan    for the love-hate food you chose earlier.    
DONE
Your recipe for a healthy relationship with food

YOU READ MY MIND
     So we know that labeling foods as "good" or "bad," "guilt-free" or "indulgent" can perpetuate an unhealthy relationship with food. And yet, we also know that this type of all-or-nothing thinking is very common, especially in the world of weight loss.               Now you might be asking yourself: What might a healthy relationship with food look like, then?    


TELL ME MORE
 At Noom we believe that a healthy relationship with food will look different for each person—we are all unique, after all.            That being said, we've identified 4 “ingredients” that make up a recipe for a healthy relationship with food:       <ol><li>Permission to eat all foods   </li><li>Enjoying all foods without feelings of guilt or shame   </li><li>Making mindful food choices   </li><li>Honoring your body's feedback</li></ol>           


NEXT
Ingredient 1: Permission to eat all foods    Allow yourself to eat all foods and food groups. Giving yourself permission to eat foods you love—be it dumplings or a Greek salad—at any time is key to fostering a mindset around food that isn't restrictive, but free.      Let us repeat:    You can eat any food at any time.    We're here to help you understand    why    you're making certain food choices, not police them. 


NEXT
Ingredient 2: Enjoying foods without feelings of guilt or shame    When you do allow yourself to enjoy foods you like, this should come without feelings of guilt or regret (or continuing to think about your choices hours after eating).            Now, we aren't naive—we know that this might not feel so easy in the world we live in. (Seriously, have you ever noticed how many foods at the supermarket are labeled "guilt-free"? The answer is: a lot.)           What we do know is that continuing to remove "good" and "bad" labels from food can help us feel okay after eating just about anything.       


NEXT
Ingredient 3: Making mindful food choices    While we don't want you spending most of your waking hours thinking about food, applying mindfulness to your food choices when planning your meals or sitting down to eat is important in developing a healthy relationship with food.            This means using your knowledge of nutrition and your wants and preferences to enjoy foods that make you feel good in body, mind, and spirit.          


NEXT
Ingredient 4: Honoring your body's feedback    We put a lot of thought, effort, flexibility, and—most importantly—science into calculating your customized calorie range. That being said, as you've learned,    your needs can vary from day to day, and your body knows what you need at any given moment.    It’s better than any math equation.        If you've reached your calorie goal and are still feeling hungry, there's only one appropriate response: eat (and eat until you feel satisfied!).          


COUNT ME IN
 While this recipe might feel    simple    in nature (it's only 4 ingredients, right?!), we know that our relationship with food is complicated, especially for those of us who've attempted to change our eating habits or lose weight in the past.            That being said, from exploring all-or-nothing thinking to identifying subtle hunger and fullness cues, we're here to guide you towards developing the habits that will help you feel good about your relationship with food for life.

Bundle your habits

I REMEMBER
 Remember temptation bundling?          Temptation bundling is pairing something that we enjoy (like playing a video game or taking a hot bath) with something less fun that we “should” be doing (like sit-ups or our taxes). This makes us more likely to do the not-so-fun chore.       


NEXT
 Now meet temptation bundling’s best friend, habit bundling.         Habit bundling is combining an established habit with a new habit.    (Talk about a cute first date.)


NEXT
 You already know that    habits take time—sometimes, quite a bit of time—to develop.          But we can build them faster with this simple    Psych Trick.          After all, learning to tango is a lot easier when you pair up with a professional rather than trying to learn all by yourself. Or with someone with two left feet. (That someone is us.)          


LET'S
    Think of your current habit as a support system for your new habit. You want to bundle a new habit with a current,    related    habit.          You don’t want a cheerleader to teach you how to tango. You want a ballroom dancer to teach you how to tango.       Let’s look at an example.          


NEXT
 You’ve already befriended breakfast. (At least we hope.) This is your established habit—every morning, rain or shine, personal chef or no personal chef.        Now you’re looking to break up with processed foods… or at least eat less of them. This is your    new    habit.       You start by taking a look at your current breakfast spread:   <ul><li>2 slices whole-grain toast with 1 tablespoon hydrogenated (solid) peanut butter</li><li>1/2 cup nonfat strawberry Greek yogurt topped with 1/4 cup granola</li></ul> While you’re making some nutritious choices, you realize there’s room for improvement on the processed front.       Hydrogenated (solid) peanut butter contains added salt, sugar, and fat.   <ul><li>Ingredients: roasted peanuts and    sugar   , contains 2% or less of:    molasses   ,    fully hydrogenated vegetable oils    (rapeseed and soybean),    mono and diglycerides   ,    salt   .</li></ul> Nonfat strawberry Greek yogurt contains added sugar and lots of unnecessary additives.   <ul><li>Ingredients: cultured grade A nonfat milk,    cane sugar   , strawberries, water, contains less than 1% of: corn starch, natural flavors,    fruit and vegetable juice    (for color), carob bean gum, lemon juice concentrate, vitamin D3.</li></ul> A lot of ingredients, we know.          


THEN WHAT?
    Try to take advantage of your breakfast habit in order to practice your new habit of eating fewer processed foods.          Make a plan:   <ul><li>Trade in hydrogenated peanut butter for natural peanut butter. (Get this: It’s just peanuts.)</li><li>Flavor your own Greek yogurt by mixing diced strawberries with plain, unsweetened Greek yogurt. (Pro tip: When frozen berries defrost, their juices make yogurt naturally sweet.)</li></ul> Then, commit to making this swap every day for at least two weeks.   


DONE
 After two weeks, your desired habit (eating whole, unprocessed foods for breakfast) will probably become a habit. Maybe not an established habit, but a habit you’re well on your way to building. (It’s not magic. It’s psychology.)       Habit bundling = Current habit + New habit          Now it’s your turn. Create your habit bundling equation. We’re rooting for you.   
DONE
Stay motivated

WHAT CHANGED?
 At the end of his 16-week course with Noom, here’s what Taro had to say:              “I never understood moderation before Noom. I was on or off… healthy or totally eating awful. I had no idea how to find balance. Now I am not on it or off it. I’m on a new and entirely different road!”   


TELL ME MORE
    His mind, of course.      


NEXT
 Taro knew that vegetables and fruit, lean proteins, and other whole foods were important for a healthy body. And he knew that these were more nutritious choices than chips, crackers, candy, and other processed foods.       What he didn’t know was that kale isn’t a “diet food,” bagels aren’t inherently “bad,” and dessert isn’t “off-limits.” These were all things that family, friends, trendy diets, and the media had been telling him for years.        So over time, he had started to believe it. (And who wouldn’t?)   


NEXT
 When chatting with Coach Shannon, Taro talked about “cheating” on his diet one weekend. Of course, Coach Shannon did some digging. (That’s what Noom coaches do.)      Turns out, Taro had lists of foods he “could” and “couldn’t” eat. Coach Shannon saw the perfect opportunity to introduce Taro to    the label loop.   


NEXT
 For the next few weeks, Taro and Coach Shannon worked together to    help Taro shake this all-or-nothing mentality.          The first step was identifying all the foods Taro had labeled as “good” or “bad,” and “free” or “off-limits.”      The next step was encouraging Taro to    give himself permission to eat these foods whenever he wanted   , as long as he stayed within his desired calorie budget. (Bring on half a bagel, toasted, please!)


NEXT
 Despite Taro’s original thought distortions (   I can never eat bagels; Lemon bars will sabotage my progress   ), he continued to lose weight and reach his health goals.          When Taro started allowing himself to eat whatever foods he desired (in moderation, of course), he found that making healthy choices became easier. Hat tip to psychology.             


DONE
 Taro’s success proves just how powerful our brains really are.       Now, don’t get us wrong. It wasn’t easy. It took Taro years to create all those labels, so losing them didn’t happen overnight.       But with time, practice, hard work—and the help of a dedicated coach—he did it.       You can break up with labels, too—and even enjoy the occasional toasted bagel.

Meet Alicia

INSPIRE ME
 Ready to meet another Noom user who lost weight by taking advantage of keystone habits?              It's time to get inspired by Alicia.   


NEXT
 <embed alt="alicia after" embedtype="image" format="left" id="4545"/>              Meet Alicia. Here’s what she had to say about Noom after 16 weeks:                 “By joining and completing the Noom program, I learned how to lead a healthy lifestyle while still tackling all that life throws my way.”           Okay, we’re already blushing. You may be wondering, how’d Alicia do it?   


NEXT
 Developing realistic, sustainable habits. (That’s our love language. Swoon.)      


NEXT
 Alicia had tried a variety of trendy fitness apps over the years. They’d work for a little while, but keeping up with all their recommendations was impossible because she didn’t actually enjoy them and they didn’t fit into her lifestyle. Plus, these subscriptions didn’t help her break any of her old habits.       So, after a couple of months, she’d go right back to her old ways and gain all the weight back (and then some).   


NEXT
 One reason why? For years, Alicia’s biggest struggle was feeling overwhelmed by multiple drastic changes all at once.        So she and Coach Adam broke everything down into small, achievable goals; set weekly check-ins; identified obstacles; and adjusted things along the way.       Alicia stayed stubborn about her goals, but was flexible about her methods. She knew she needed to find a realistic routine in order for her habits to stick.          


HOW?
 And she felt relieved that she wasn’t being asked to change everything on day one.       “Tracking my food by category, trying to hit my step goals, increasing my physical activity a little at a time, and being held accountable to my coach, I gradually built upon the habits without completely changing my life in one day.”       While Alicia’s life didn’t transform overnight, it did eventually.   


I'M INSPIRED
 She developed keystone habits like losing the labels and unprocessing her diet, too.       “Without a doubt, I have an improved relationship with food. My body is loving all the fresh fruits and vegetables and whole grains—if I go a day without eating a salad, I start to crave it. I am no longer craving fried foods or sweets regularly, and I feel a difference when I do eat them.”       These habits have helped her change her behavior chain.       “When I’ve had a stressful day, I still want to reach for the cookies but feel so much more satisfied when I complete a tough workout instead.”       And now she’s got a sustainable plan she can stick with for good.       “I have developed healthy habits that are now second nature to me.”       For the record, we’re still blushing.

Keystone habit #6: Ditch the drinks

 And no, we’re not talking about water. (You know how we feel about water. It’s truly magical.)   


NEXT
 When we say drinks, we're talking about    sugar-sweetened beverages      .                  Think soft drinks, fruit drinks, sports drinks, energy drinks, and sweetened coffees and teas, which together account for    47% of the added sugar in our diets      .      


NEXT
 You’ve already learned that    foods with lots of added sugar make you crash and burn, and leave you wanting more      .              Drinks    with lots of added sugar are even more concerning.        So, what’s the problem with sugar-sweetened beverages? We’ve got four of them, to be exact.          


NEXT
Concern #1: They don’t impact satiety Don’t let those cute kids running that lemonade stand fool you. A lemonade on a hot summer day may taste refreshing. But, unfortunately, it’s just tart, sweet    liquid calories      .                     Besides chemicals like monopotassium phosphate, calcium disodium EDTA, and caramel color,    sugar-sweetened beverages    contain pretty much one thing : sugar. Even if it’s disguised as high-fructose corn syrup, glucose, sucrose, or dextrose on the ingredients list.                    Sugar-sweetened beverages are pretty much devoid of anything that makes you full.    They contain…    <ul><li>No protein</li><li>No fiber</li><li>No healthy fats</li></ul> A certain (very popular) soda’s nutrition facts label:    <embed alt="day20-task2-6B.png" embedtype="image" format="left" id="4520"/>      


NEXT
Concern #2: They make you hungrier    According to registered dietitian Katherine Tallmadge, MA, RD, your body’s hunger hormones respond differently to drinks than if you were to consume equal calories of other foods.        In other words, you don’t get full on those calories you drink. Instead, you get hungrier. Don’t you just love paradoxes?   


NEXT
Concern #3: They make you eat more    Studies have found that    people who drink sugar-sweetened beverages during their meals eat more calories.          But not just because they’re drinking more calories...      The excess calories    surpass    the number of calories from their sugary drink of choice. So, perhaps that sweet tea is impacting your body's ability to feel full. 


DONE
Concern #4: They interfere with weight loss    Sugar-sweetened beverages might be sabotaging your progress. But the good news is that ditching soda and choosing water instead can help with weight loss.        Water works wonders in many ways. For example:    <ul><li>   Drinking water instead of sugar-sweetened beverages lowers your overall calorie intake.    </li><li>   Increasing your water intake might increase your daily calorie burn      :    It’s called water-induced thermogenesis. Studies show that drinking 500 milliliters of water can increase your metabolic rate by 30%. (That’s what we call science magic.)</li></ul> While hydration is a little different for everybody, one thing’s for sure: Water is really important.        Still think water’s boring? Add lemon or cucumber, or try any of the other tricks we’ve mentioned. Those all count, too!       Now, pour yourself a glass, and head to your next lesson to find out why we’re wild for water.

(That’s what we call science magic.)</li></ul> While hydration is a little different for everybody, one thing’s for sure: Water is really important.        Still think water’s boring? Add lemon or cucumber, or try any of the other tricks we’ve mentioned. Those all count, too!

 Now you might be asking yourself:    What about the alcohol I enjoy a few times per week?                     Unlike soda and sugary drinks, alcohol’s a little trickier.            The    Current Obesity Reports    journal found that    light to moderate drinking doesn’t seem to affect weight gain or obesity      .    (Although we’re not so sure about that—the science is still evolving.)            On the other hand,    if you drink a lot regularly, you are more likely to gain weight.              Noom's not-so-controversial and oh-so-sustainable take: drink alcohol in moderation if you enjoy it.

Hydrate the right way

NEXT
 You may remember this from your first day on Noom… but now let’s wade into the deep end. Of water, that is.   
 First, tell us: How many cups of water should you drink each day?      
NEXT
A. 5 cups
B. 8 cups
C. 10 cups
D. Depends on a few things
 It’s:    D. Depends on a few things.          


NEXT
 You’ve probably heard something about needing to drink 8 cups of water a day. While it’s a worthy goal, water is a bit more complicated than that.      


NEXT
    Your sex, age, weight, height, and activity level play the biggest roles in your water needs.    If you’re like most people, 2 to 3 liters (or 8 to 12 cups) per day should be enough to keep your body hydrated.       But things like exercising more often, being in a warmer or more humid environment, or experiencing health changes can increase the amount of water you need in a day. (For example, hiking in the Galapagos versus reading this lesson from the comfort of your climate-controlled apartment.)           


GOT IT
    Your body thrives off of water.    Water helps your body flush out toxins, it keeps your fluids balanced, and it allows your different organ systems to perform at their best.   


NEXT
 Contrary to popular belief,    those 2 to 3 liters of water don’t need to all come from a tap, a water bottle, or a fountain of youth. (Wait, you have access to one of those?)          Foods like fruits and vegetables are especially good sources of water—three cheers for low-caloric-density foods. And drinks like tea can be hydrating, too.       With this in mind, we’ve put together some great ways to quench your thirst.          


DONE
Hydration tricks    1.    Wake up and water   : First thing in the morning, polish off a large glass of water. It’ll kickstart your water intake and is a great way to rehydrate after a long night’s sleep.    2.    Keep it around   : Out of sight, out of mind—so carry a reusable water bottle with you throughout the day.       3.    Take a break   : Replace your traditional morning coffee break with a water break.          
4.    Serve it as a side   : Serve (and commit to finishing) a glass of water with each meal and snack.    5.    Warm it up   : Hydrate with a cup of herbal tea or hot water and lemon.       6.    Get fresh   : Fruits and vegetables are great sources of water. Some water-packed superstars include watermelon, grapefruit, and cantaloupe. Aim for 5 to 10 servings of vegetables or fruit each day to stay hydrated.       7.    Flavor it   : Add fresh-squeezed lemon and lime, a handful of berries, or a splash of 100% juice.       8.    Add bubbles   : Have a glass of sparkling or seltzer water—this absolutely counts, too.

Soup up your diet

SHOW ME
 So, you’ve already ditched the sugar-sweetened beverages. After all, they don’t impact satiety or give your body any real nutrients.                     But what about when a food is kind of a liquid, like a soup or a stew? Or that mush they used to serve you in middle school?                 Luckily, the answer is clearer—and brothier—than you might think.           Allow us to illustrate.   
 Your restaurant meal comes with a soup or salad. You should choose…       
NEXT
A. Soup.
B. Salad.
C. Either.
D. Neither—I’m here for one thing, and it’s those house-made pickles.
E. It depends.
 It’s:    E. It depends.          


NEXT
 Is the soup a veggie-packed borscht? Or is it a cream of mushroom? Are you deciding between a light vinaigrette or a caesar dressing?       If your only options are cream of mushroom soup or creamy salad, you might want to skip the appetizer entirely. But if you’re given the choice between a veggie-heavy soup or a light salad, try what we like to call the    starter strategy.          To do this, pick a light, low-calorie appetizer to help fill you up before your main course arrives.        And yes, this really works.    Studies show that people who start their meals with a low-calorie dish like soup or salad end up eating fewer calories overall.              One study even found that participants who slurped a low-calorie soup before their lunch hit the table reduced the calories they ate by 20%. Nice work, soup!             
 Which of these is the most filling?       
NEXT
A. 3 cups of chicken-and-vegetable soup (250 calories)
B. A 4-ounce chicken breast with 1 cup roasted vegetables (250 calories)
C. They’re equally filling.
 It’s:    A. 3 cups of chicken-and-vegetable soup (250 calories).         


NEXT
 We know what you’re thinking:    Is soup actually more satisfying than, you know, regular food? That you have to chew?                    Yes. Yes it is.           When Dr. Miriam Clegg at Oxford Brookes University heard this idea, she was skeptical, too. So she set out to prove or disprove it. By the way, we love ourselves a skeptical scientist.   


NEXT
 Her study confirmed that soups can indeed be more satiating than solid food, and here’s why:       Compared to solid food, your body registers that soup sooner,    and    it even stays in your stomach longer.      In other words?    Eating soup produces immediate and sustained satiety.    (Just don’t burn your tongue.) 
 Which soup is more satiating?      
NEXT
A. 2 cups of a chunky Italian wedding soup
B. 2 cups of a velvety smooth carrot ginger soup
C. Either
D. Neither
 It’s:    C. Either      .    Surprisingly, chunky doesn’t make you more full. (But it does make you feel more rustic. Ooh.)      


NEXT
 Assuming the calories are equal, it doesn’t matter if the soup you’re eating is smooth or chunky. Both soups are equally effective at making you feel full, at least according to a study published in the journal    Appetite   . (A journal about food? Get us a lifetime subscription.)          The study started with six identical ingredients   : chicken broth, broccoli, potato, cauliflower, carrots, and butter.            They used these ingredients to make four types of soup   : broth with veggies, chunky soup, chunky pureed soup, and pureed soup.       Like most people, they assumed that increasing the chunkiness or chewiness of a soup would make it more filling. But actually, all the soups were equally filling. That’s good news for anyone who’s already splurged on an immersion blender.          


DONE
 Moral of the story?       In general, liquid calories aren’t satisfying—and chewing your calories usually is.        But healthy soup is a different story. Start your meal with a cup of split pea, and you’ll probably eat a lot less of your entrée. Which also means you’ll get leftovers for lunch tomorrow.        Hat tip to psychology. And to-go boxes.

Make your habits stick

I REMEMBER
 You’ve already learned a lot of Psych Tricks and practical tips to make different keystone habits stick, including:      <ul><li>Planning ahead to befriend breakfast.</li><li>Using a side plate to control your portions. (Or a side bowl, if you’re doing the soup trick.)</li><li>Eating more whole foods and fewer processed ones.</li><li>Stopping the labeling of foods as “good” or “bad”—all food is wonderful, remember? Even chocolate chip cookies.</li><li>Choosing the    right    liquid calories.</li></ul>


NEXT
 You may recall Noom user Pam’s wise words: “You’ve created a habit when it’s no longer what you do, it’s who you are!”                 But how do you make that happen, really?                     With psychology, that’s how.              Habit bundling, for example, can help make any habit stick. But now we’ve got another habit tip for you…    


NEXT
It’s single-tasking.         That’s right, single-tasking.       You’ve probably heard of its cousin, multitasking, who tells us that we can do    everything    at once. Yep, we’ve seen you walk the dog, text your boss, and drink a coffee all at once. It’s impressive, but still.                 Single-tasking is the opposite of multitasking.              It’s doing just one task at a time, so you can do it well and then get on with your day. (Unbelievable, we know.)   


NEXT
 Ever heard of    ego depletion   ? We’ll break it down.       Our self-control (our rider) is a limited resource. When we single-task, we sip on our willpower resources from a straw. When we multitask, we require several straws. When that doesn’t work, we rip off the lid and start chugging.       And so, very quickly, our willpower dries up. That’s ego depletion.      This is also why you shouldn’t befriend breakfast, unprocess your diet,    and    lose the labels all at once. Sure, you could try, but you’d likely run out of the willpower it takes to pull it off.


DONE
    Instead, focus your efforts on achieving one goal at a time.           Tomorrow, you’ll decide which keystone habit you want to work on developing next week. Remember, you’re not going to try to build all these habits at once. We prefer your ego intact, thank you very much.       While you will eventually work on developing most of these keystone habits, there’s no rush. There is plenty of time to work on, well, everything.

Keystone Habit #7: Eat mindfully        Take a guess: How much of their time do you think people spend thinking about the past or the future?      
NEXT
A. 5%
B. 12%
C. 24%
D. 32%
E. None of the above
 It’s:    D. 32%      .    Surprising, right? That’s a lot of time not spent in the present.       


NEXT
 Our brains are especially prone to wandering away from the present moment while we are eating, because eating is an    automatic behavior.             Psychologists describe    automatic behaviors    as    actions that happen without conscious effort, since we repeat them so much   —things like driving, showering, or brushing our teeth.       Eating falls into this category because we do it so often. Lucky us.            Here’s the thing, though: Just because eating is an automatic behavior doesn’t mean that we can’t get it under control. To do this,    we need to retrain our brains      .    That’s where Keystone Habit #7 comes in.          


NEXT
Keystone habit #7: Eat mindfully    Our final keystone habit is mindful eating, which means eating with…   <ol><li>   Intention   : Don’t just eat because it’s teatime and there’s a tiered tray of cucumber sandwiches right in front of your face. </li><li>   Attention   : Focus on the meal, not today’s to-do list. </li></ol>

Ace mindful eating, part 1        What is the French Paradox? Take your best guess.   
NEXT
A. That there’s nothing more American than french fries.
B. The fact that there are low rates of heart disease in France, even though people there eat lots of foods that are high in cholesterol and saturated fat, like meat and cheese.
C. That the French term for weekend is “le weekend.”
D. I have no idea.
 It’s:    B. The fact that there are low rates of heart disease in France, even though people there eat lots of foods that are high in cholesterol and saturated fat, like meat and cheese      .          


SAY MORE
 That the French have low rates of heart disease helps drive home an important point:    it's not just about what you eat, but also the way you eat—how you enjoy your meal.      


NEXT
 A lot of people, from a lot of different countries, just adore eating meats and cheese, and the French are definitely no exception.        So what’s the difference between the French and Americans? One possible explanation is that many Americans tend to eat on the go, whereas in France, it’s more culturally common to make time to sit down and enjoy a meal. (Groundbreaking, we know.)   


NEXT
 All too often, we scarf down food while zipping from one place to another—or jumping from one task to the next. Instead of eating true meals, we snack all day long.       It’s a banana as you leave the house in the morning, a stale muffin before your lunch break, a bag of flaming-hot-something-or-other to push you through the afternoon slump, maybe some leftover fried rice when you get home from work, and a few bites of ice cream to wrap up the evening.       The next day, it’s more of the same. Drive-throughs, snack packs, and tiny bites here and there.           


WHAT IS IT?
 In French culture, it’s more common to:    <ul><li>   Sit down   : Whether they have prepared food or not, they usually eat food sitting down at a table. (A real table. Not a desk or a park bench or the dashboard of your car.)</li><li>   Slow down   : They take an extended lunch hour. While we know most people don’t have that luxury, slowing down your day and just taking a few minutes to unwind can make a big difference.</li><li>   Enjoy   : Eating is just as much social as it is physical. Meals are spent exchanging stories, laughing, and enjoying the company of others—not stressing about anything and everything. No matter what you're eating, there’s no disputing that enjoying your meal is healthy.</li></ul> That brings us to mindful eating tip #1.    


WHAT'S STEP 2?
Mindful eating tip #1: Make it an event    When you make your meal an event, you make it meaningful. You make it count. And hopefully, you make it longer than three minutes.       After all, mindful eating is a two-step process:   Step 1: Set an eating schedule    Think about other events in your life: conferences, concerts, coffee dates. These events all have start times, right?    Events are time-bound.    And you can apply this same scheduling to your meals and snacks.       For example:   <ul><li>Breakfast at 7:30 a.m.</li><li>Lunch at 12:00 p.m.</li><li>Snack at 3:30 p.m.</li><li>Dinner at 6:30 p.m.</li></ul>Your schedule can be flexible (life happens), but when    you’re mindful about          when    you eat, you’re more likely to be mindful of    what    you eat      .    With a rough schedule in place, you avoid mindlessly grazing all day long. 


DONE
Step 2: Establish a true beginning, middle, and end   Events also have a beginning, a middle, and an end.            Eating a snack at 3:30 p.m. doesn’t mean opening a bag of nuts at your work desk and chomping on them all afternoon. Eating a snack at 3:30 p.m. means fetching your snack of choice (the beginning), sitting down in a designated eating area and enjoying your snack (the middle), and putting your food away to return to what you were doing beforehand (the end).          Bonus suggestion   : We like to brush our teeth after these events. Think of it like a sense of completion for you, and a bit of courtesy for others.       With these tips, you’ll be mindfully eating in no time. And your car won’t smell like chili fries anymore.       
DONE
Ace mindful eating, part 2

TRUE
 Remember how we discussed eating mindfully by making each meal an event? A la le French?Well, that’s not the only way to connect your brain and your belly.            Ready for another mindful eating tip?           We’ve all had those nights when we’ve gotten drawn into a movie or TV show, blinked our eyes, and realized that the box of cookies we’d put on the coffee table was somehow, quite mysteriously, empty.        One reason for this type of fog eating? E   lectronics make us eat more      .    True, your TV or laptop isn’t    actually    feeding you those tortilla chips, but it’s not helping your cause, either.      


NEXT
Mindful eating tip #2: Remove distractions    The    American Journal of Clinical Nutrition    examined dozens of studies that compared how much food people ate when they were in front of the TV versus when they weren’t.      And guess what? People who ate in front of the TV    always    ate more than those who didn't. What’s more, these people even ate more throughout the rest of the day—long after they turned off the morning news.


NEXT
 So go ahead and round up your TV, laptop, tablet, and all your other fancy gadgets, and put them in a bag and toss them out the window, into the toilet, or into the good old dumpster.       And by “toss them out the window, into the toilet, or into the good old dumpster” we mean put them in the other room while you’re eating.       When you want to watch TV, watch TV. When it’s time to eat, then eat. Just don’t mix the two, or you’ll discover you ate more than you planned. All day long.   


MAYBE
 But wait. That’s not all. We did a little extra digging and discovered the “crunch effect.” Sounds delicious, we agree.              Dr. Ryan Elder and his colleagues at Brigham Young University discovered that hearing yourself chew can regulate how much you eat. They called it the “crunch effect,” and they found that “the salience of a food’s sound can in fact significantly impact the quantity of food a person eats.”          Which means...       The more you hear yourself chew, the less you eat.    (Especially if you’re on a conference call.)       This could be because people don’t like hearing themselves chew.        But the main reason behind this phenomenon is likely that the crunch helps our mind connect the dots and process the external cues (chomping down on seaweed salad) with the internal ones (all the metabolic changes that happen when you eat).        Maybe, just maybe, thanks to all that crunching, you’ll register your fullness sooner.   


DONE
 Now take a moment to think about your biggest dietary distraction.       Do you read the news with breakfast? Do you scroll through social media at lunch? Do you snack at your computer at work? Do you eat dinner in front of the TV?       Next,    think about how you can ditch your distraction      .    Could you ask a coworker to join you outside to eat on your lunch break? Keep your food in your backpack and make it a point to sit down and enjoy your snack whenever and wherever hunger strikes? Create a “no food outside the kitchen” policy to avoid watching the basketball game at dinner? (Unless it’s the playoffs, of course.)

Could you answer those questions? If so, was it difficult? Did you have to think about it for a while?           If thinking about your food like this was hard, that’s totally normal. And it’s because you weren’t present during your meal. (Or that you were watching TV. Or even reading a Noom lesson.)

 When you think about eating, you probably think about taste, right? After all, food is tasty.         But actually, when you use    all your senses    to experience your food, it can really help you make your meals more mindful.    


NEXT
Mindful eating tip #3: Engage your senses    Before taking your first bite, stop for a moment and ask yourself a few questions:   <ul><li>   How does my meal look?   </li><li>   How does it smell?   </li><li>   How does it feel?    (Permission to play with your food, granted.)</li></ul>    Then, during each bite, ask yourself:   <ul><li>   How does the food feel in my mouth as I chew?   </li><li>   How does this bite taste?   </li><li>   How does this bite compare to the last?   </li></ul>


DONE
 When you think and chew, you engage your senses. This helps you…    <ul><li>   Enjoy your food   : When you savor every bite of that cake, you satisfy a craving and are less likely to want cake again tomorrow. (Or chips or calzone or whatever your “thing” is.)</li><li>   Register your fullness   : It takes a while to know you’re full—up to twenty minutes. So if you slow down, you’ll eat less…because your body will    want    to eat less.</li><li>   Stop when you’re satisfied   : Ever notice that the last bite isn’t as enjoyable as the first? By focusing on every bite, you’ll stop eating the instant you’re no longer enjoying your food, and leave the table feeling satisfied.</li></ul> Now it’s time to take some of our own advice, and stop when we’re satisfied.           Ready to move on?

Body, meet mind

NEXT
 Just like your mind talks to your body,    your body also talks to your mind.                  When people think of body language, they usually think about how we communicate using our hands, our faces, and—you guessed it—our bodies.   <ul><li>Smiling tells someone “I’m friendly” or “I’m happy to see you.” </li><li>Good posture tells others “I’m proud” or “I’m confident."</li><li>Crossing your arms tells your significant other “I’m angry” or “I’m annoyed.”</li></ul>


SHOULDERS BACK
 What most of us don’t think about is how these nonverbal cues affect our minds.               A study published in the journal    Health Psychology    split participants into two groups:   <ul><li>   Group A    was strapped up with physiotherapy tape to have a slouched posture.</li><li>   Group B    was strapped to have proper posture. </li></ul>    The scientists then asked both groups to do a psychologically stressful task.        Can you guess what happened?        The uprights reported higher self-esteem and a more positive mood than the slouchers—even in the face of stress. Better posture made group B feel more resilient.          What we do with our bodies matters. And our brains are listening.      


NEXT
 Speaking of how much your body and mind are connected, now is a good time to point out that regular movement is beneficial for your body and your mind.                 Yes, we’re sure you’ve heard that before. That’s because there’s tons of science to back it up—research has consistently shown that regular physical activity helps reduce anxiety, depression, and negative mood.           While this connection isn’t completely understood, here are a couple reasons experts believe regular exercise can help alleviate stress and negative mood:       <ul><li>   Reduced biological stress reactivity:    Regular exercise can reduce cortisol reactivity, which may lead to improved mood.   </li><li>   Improved self-efficacy:    Exercise can boost self-efficacy, the belief that you have the capability to achieve your goals.</li></ul>


NEXT
 It’s also important to note that while “exercise” might conjure up images of running sprints on a treadmill or taking a high-intensity boxing class, research shows that physical activity (not necessarily formal exercise) can also contribute to these mood-boosting benefits.           So any activity that requires energy, works your muscles, and gets your body moving counts. Yep, walking around your neighborhood while listening to a podcast, doing household chores, or more leisurely activities like bowling all count.     


DONE
 All this to say:    Your mind and body are more connected than you think.                    We can’t change that…and we shouldn’t want to.                 Because while stress in your body causes stress in your mind, and stress in your mind causes stress in your body, the opposite is true, too.                 That means we have not one, but two ways to intervene when it comes to stress. And you know we love options.                 Grounding, for example, starts with the body but impacts the mind. And some of our next tools will start with your mind but impact your body.           How exactly? You’ll have to come back and find out.
